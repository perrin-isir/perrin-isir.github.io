Abstract      = {Model-based planning is often thought to be necessary for deep, careful
reasoning and generalization in artificial agents. While recent successes of
model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with deep function approximation have
strengthened this hypothesis, the resulting diversity of model-based methods
has also made it difficult to track which components drive success and why. In
this paper, we seek to disentangle the contributions of recent methods by
focusing on three questions: (1) How does planning benefit MBRL agents? (2)
Within planning, what choices drive performance? (3) To what extent does
planning improve generalization? To answer these questions, we study the
performance of MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art MBRL
algorithm with strong connections and overlapping components with many other
MBRL algorithms. We perform a number of interventions and ablations of MuZero
across a wide range of environments, including control tasks, Atari, and 9x9
Go. Our results suggest the following: (1) Planning is most useful in the
learning process, both for policy updates and for providing a more useful data
distribution. (2) Using shallow trees with simple Monte-Carlo rollouts is as
performant as more complex methods, except in the most difficult reasoning
tasks. (3) Planning alone is insufficient to drive strong generalization. These
results indicate where and how to utilize planning in reinforcement learning
settings, and highlight a number of open questions for future MBRL research.},

Abstract      = {We consider the problem of imitation learning from a finite set of expert
trajectories, without access to reinforcement signals. The classical approach
of extracting the expert's reward function via inverse reinforcement learning,
followed by reinforcement learning is indirect and may be computationally
expensive. Recent generative adversarial methods based on matching the policy
distribution between the expert and the agent could be unstable during
training. We propose a new framework for imitation learning by estimating the
support of the expert policy to compute a fixed reward function, which allows
us to re-frame imitation learning within the standard reinforcement learning
setting. We demonstrate the efficacy of our reward function on both discrete
and continuous domains, achieving comparable or better performance than the
state of the art under different reinforcement learning algorithms.},

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms assume that users specify tasks by
manually writing down a reward function. However, this process can be laborious
and demands considerable technical expertise. Can we devise RL algorithms that
instead enable users to specify tasks simply by providing examples of
successful outcomes? In this paper, we derive a control algorithm that
maximizes the future probability of these successful outcome examples. Prior
work has approached similar problems with a two-stage process, first learning a
reward function and then optimizing this reward function using another RL
algorithm. In contrast, our method directly learns a value function from
transitions and successful outcomes, without learning this intermediate reward
function. Our method therefore requires fewer hyperparameters to tune and lines
of code to debug. We show that our method satisfies a new data-driven Bellman
equation, where examples take the place of the typical reward function term.
Experiments show that our approach outperforms prior methods that learn
explicit reward functions.},

Abstract      = {Self-supervised goal proposal and reaching is a key component for exploration
and efficient policy learning algorithms. Such a self-supervised approach
without access to any oracle goal sampling distribution requires deep
exploration and commitment so that long horizon plans can be efficiently
discovered. In this paper, we propose an exploration framework, which learns a
dynamics-aware manifold of reachable states. For a goal, our proposed method
deterministically visits a state at the current frontier of reachable states
(commitment/reaching) and then stochastically explores to reach the goal
(exploration). This allocates exploration budget near the frontier of the
reachable region instead of its interior. We target the challenging problem of
policy learning from initial and goal states specified as images, and do not
assume any access to the underlying ground-truth states of the robot and the
environment. To keep track of reachable latent states, we propose a
distance-conditioned reachability network that is trained to infer whether one
state is reachable from another within the specified latent space distance.
Given an initial state, we obtain a frontier of reachable states from that
state. By incorporating a curriculum for sampling easier goals (closer to the
start state) before more difficult goals, we demonstrate that the proposed

Abstract      = {The optimization of functions to find the best solution according to one or

Recently, a new family of optimization algorithms, named Quality-Diversity
optimization, has been introduced, and contrasts with classic algorithms.
Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are
searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions.
The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as
much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The
contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying
framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main
algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and
the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large
variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we
propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity
algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we
present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed
when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by
extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three
different experimental scenarios.},

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning algorithms use correlations between policies and
rewards to improve agent performance. But in dynamic or sparsely rewarding
environments these correlations are often too small, or rewarding events are
too infrequent to make learning feasible. Human education instead relies on
curricula--the breakdown of tasks into simpler, static challenges with dense
rewards--to build up to complex behaviors. While curricula are also useful for
artificial agents, hand-crafting them is time consuming. This has lead
researchers to explore automatic curriculum generation. Here we explore
automatic curriculum generation in rich, dynamic environments. Using a
setter-solver paradigm we show the importance of considering goal validity,
goal feasibility, and goal coverage to construct useful curricula. We
demonstrate the success of our approach in rich but sparsely rewarding 2D and
3D environments, where an agent is tasked to achieve a single goal selected
from a set of possible goals that varies between episodes, and identify
challenges for future work. Finally, we demonstrate the value of a novel
technique that guides agents towards a desired goal distribution. Altogether,
these results represent a substantial step towards applying automatic task
curricula to learn complex, otherwise unlearnable goals, and to our knowledge
are the first to demonstrate automated curriculum generation for
goal-conditioned agents in environments where the possible goals vary between
episodes.},

Abstract      = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully
applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks.
However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample
complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit
the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we
describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy
actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this
framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and
entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible.
We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training
and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a
constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature
hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks,
as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal
robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements,
SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and
off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms,
our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different
random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for
learning in real-world robotics tasks.},

Although these methods can be quite capable, they do not scale well with the

We consider learning a forward dynamics model to predict the result,
($x_{t+1}$), of taking a particular action, ($u$), given a specific observation

prior tasks can be used to inform how exploration should be performed in new
tasks. In this work, we explore how prior tasks can inform an agent about how
to explore effectively in new situations. We introduce a novel gradient-based
fast adaptation algorithm -- model agnostic exploration with structured noise
(MAESN) -- to learn exploration strategies from prior experience. The prior
experience is used both to initialize a policy and to acquire a latent
exploration space that can inject structured stochasticity into a policy,
producing exploration strategies that are informed by prior knowledge and are
more effective than random action-space noise. We show that MAESN is more
effective at learning exploration strategies when compared to prior meta-RL
methods, RL without learned exploration strategies, and task-agnostic
exploration methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated tasks:
locomotion with a wheeled robot, locomotion with a quadrupedal walker, and

is that the information of the best policy is fused in a soft manner by
constructing an augmented loss function for policy update to enlarge the
overall search region by the multiple learners. The guidance by the previous
best policy and the enlarged range enable faster and better policy search.
Monotone improvement of the expected cumulative return by the proposed scheme

of the amplification of local approximation errors. We address this by
proposing an algorithm that adaptively switches between TD and MC in each

learned confidence intervals that detect biases of TD estimates. We demonstrate
in a variety of policy evaluation tasks that this simple adaptive algorithm

manipulate objects into a desired configuration. For example, we might want a
robot to align and assemble a gear onto an axle or insert and turn a key in a
lock. These goal-oriented tasks present a considerable challenge for
reinforcement learning, since their natural reward function is sparse and
prohibitive amounts of exploration are required to reach the goal and receive
some learning signal. Past approaches tackle these problems by exploiting
expert demonstrations or by manually designing a task-specific reward shaping
function to guide the learning agent. Instead, we propose a method to learn
these tasks without requiring any prior knowledge other than obtaining a single
state in which the task is achieved. The robot is trained in reverse, gradually
learning to reach the goal from a set of start states increasingly far from the
goal. Our method automatically generates a curriculum of start states that
adapts to the agent's performance, leading to efficient training on
goal-oriented tasks. We demonstrate our approach on difficult simulated
navigation and fine-grained manipulation problems, not solvable by
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.},

Abstract      = {Unsupervised representation learning has succeeded with excellent results in
many applications. It is an especially powerful tool to learn a good
representation of environments with partial or noisy observations. In partially
observable domains it is important for the representation to encode a belief
state, a sufficient statistic of the observations seen so far. In this paper,
we investigate whether it is possible to learn such a belief representation
using modern neural architectures. Specifically, we focus on one-step frame
prediction and two variants of contrastive predictive coding (CPC) as the
objective functions to learn the representations. To evaluate these learned
representations, we test how well they can predict various pieces of
information about the underlying state of the environment, e.g., position of
the agent in a 3D maze. We show that all three methods are able to learn belief
representations of the environment, they encode not only the state information,
but also its uncertainty, a crucial aspect of belief states. We also find that
for CPC multi-step predictions and action-conditioning are critical for
accurate belief representations in visually complex environments. The ability
of neural representations to capture the belief information has the potential
to spur new advances for learning and planning in partially observable domains,
where leveraging uncertainty is essential for optimal decision making.},

the state entropy can be estimated in a stable and compute-efficient manner by
utilizing a randomly initialized encoder, which is fixed throughout training.

allows learning diverse behaviors without extrinsic rewards, effectively

meaningful action space, among others. However, in fully observed, Markovian

benefits over standard "shallow" RL architectures. In this work, we isolate and
evaluate the claimed benefits of hierarchical RL on a suite of tasks
encompassing locomotion, navigation, and manipulation. Surprisingly, we find
that most of the observed benefits of hierarchy can be attributed to improved
exploration, as opposed to easier policy learning or imposed hierarchical
structures. Given this insight, we present exploration techniques inspired by
hierarchy that achieve performance competitive with hierarchical RL while at

challenging due to sample inefficiency. Consequently, the success of DRL in
robotics has thus far been limited to simpler manipulators and tasks. In this
work, we show that model-free DRL can effectively scale up to complex
manipulation tasks with a high-dimensional 24-DoF hand, and solve them from
scratch in simulated experiments. Furthermore, with the use of a small number
of human demonstrations, the sample complexity can be significantly reduced,

to operate in multiple perceptually diverse environments with distinct
affordances. By learning to compose lower-level programs to express
higher-level programs, NPI reduces sample complexity and increases

read-write pointers) to cache intermediate results of computation, lessening
the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train
the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example
sequences of calls to the immediate subprograms conditioned on the input.
Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns

generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic
for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization.
Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can
exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent

proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely
used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent

L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in
cross-validation accuracy. It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it

levels in the hierarchy, making it difficult to jointly learn multiple levels
of policies. In this paper, we introduce a new Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) framework, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), that can overcome
the instability issues that arise when agents try to jointly learn multiple
levels of policies. The main idea behind HAC is to train each level of the
hierarchy independently of the lower levels by training each level as if the
lower level policies are already optimal. We demonstrate experimentally in both
grid world and simulated robotics domains that our approach can significantly
accelerate learning relative to other non-hierarchical and hierarchical
methods. Indeed, our framework is the first to successfully learn 3-level
hierarchies in parallel in tasks with continuous state and action spaces.},

knowledge about the structure of the world, represented either implicitly in a
value or policy function, or explicitly in a transition model. Here we
introduce a new class of learnable models--based on graph networks--which
implement an inductive bias for object- and relation-centric representations of
complex, dynamical systems. Our results show that as a forward model, our
approach supports accurate predictions from real and simulated data, and
surprisingly strong and efficient generalization, across eight distinct
physical systems which we varied parametrically and structurally. We also found
that our inference model can perform system identification. Our models are also
differentiable, and support online planning via gradient-based trajectory
optimization, as well as offline policy optimization. Our framework offers new
opportunities for harnessing and exploiting rich knowledge about the world, and
takes a key step toward building machines with more human-like representations

Abstract      = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making
major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and
decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute
resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many
defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much
different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular,
generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from
infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI.
  The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We
argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to
achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and
computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature
and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between
"hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an
approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how
using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can
facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We
present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational
inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various
approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a
straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing
structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational
reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more
sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a
companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for
building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what
relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work,
we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to
assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations'
for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned
attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of
feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions
that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard
attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be
treated as though they do. Code for all experiments is available at

Abstract      = {Learning locomotion skills is a challenging problem. To generate realistic
and smooth locomotion, existing methods use motion capture, finite state
machines or morphology-specific knowledge to guide the motion generation
algorithms. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for the
automatic creation of locomotion control. Indeed, a standard benchmark for DRL
is to automatically create a running controller for a biped character from a
simple reward function. Although several different DRL algorithms can
successfully create a running controller, the resulting motions usually look
nothing like a real runner. This paper takes a minimalist learning approach to
the locomotion problem, without the use of motion examples, finite state
machines, or morphology-specific knowledge. We introduce two modifications to
the DRL approach that, when used together, produce locomotion behaviors that
are symmetric, low-energy, and much closer to that of a real person. First, we
introduce a new term to the loss function (not the reward function) that
encourages symmetric actions. Second, we introduce a new curriculum learning
method that provides modulated physical assistance to help the character with
left/right balance and forward movement. The algorithm automatically computes
appropriate assistance to the character and gradually relaxes this assistance,
so that eventually the character learns to move entirely without help. Because
our method does not make use of motion capture data, it can be applied to a
variety of character morphologies. We demonstrate locomotion controllers for
the lower half of a biped, a full humanoid, a quadruped, and a hexapod. Our
results show that learned policies are able to produce symmetric, low-energy
gaits. In addition, speed-appropriate gait patterns emerge without any guidance
from motion examples or contact planning.},

Abstract      = {We introduce the "NoBackTrack" algorithm to train the parameters of dynamical
systems such as recurrent neural networks. This algorithm works in an online,
memoryless setting, thus requiring no backpropagation through time, and is
scalable, avoiding the large computational and memory cost of maintaining the
full gradient of the current state with respect to the parameters.
  The algorithm essentially maintains, at each time, a single search direction
in parameter space. The evolution of this search direction is partly stochastic
and is constructed in such a way to provide, at every time, an unbiased random
estimate of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
Because the gradient estimate is unbiased, on average over time the parameter
is updated as it should.
  The resulting gradient estimate can then be fed to a lightweight Kalman-like
filter to yield an improved algorithm. For recurrent neural networks, the
resulting algorithms scale linearly with the number of parameters.
  Small-scale experiments confirm the suitability of the approach, showing that
the stochastic approximation of the gradient introduced in the algorithm is not
detrimental to learning. In particular, the Kalman-like version of NoBackTrack
is superior to backpropagation through time (BPTT) when the time span of
dependencies in the data is longer than the truncation span for BPTT.},

real-world tasks out of practical reach of RL methods. In this work, we use
demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to
perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as
stacking blocks with a robot arm. Our method, which builds on top of Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradients and Hindsight Experience Replay, provides an
order of magnitude of speedup over RL on simulated robotics tasks. It is simple
to implement and makes only the additional assumption that we can collect a
small set of demonstrations. Furthermore, our method is able to solve tasks not
solvable by either RL or behavior cloning alone, and often ends up
outperforming the demonstrator policy.},

enables posterior sampling for structured and efficient exploration. We
demonstrate how to integrate these task variables with off-policy RL algorithms

Abstract      = {A grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration,
especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as
benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall.
On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic
motivation, which is the dominant method to improve performance on
hard-exploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new
algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember
previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without
exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments
through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then
robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a
dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma's
Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the
previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain
knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on
Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the
human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of "superhuman"
performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first
algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds
expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing
demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation
learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up
many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into
current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable
hard-exploration problems in many domains, especially those that harness a
simulator during training (e.g. robotics).},

Abstract      = {It has long been assumed that high dimensional continuous control problems
cannot be solved effectively by discretizing individual dimensions of the
action space due to the exponentially large number of bins over which policies
would have to be learned. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the recent
success of sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction problems to
develop policies over discretized spaces. Central to this method is the
realization that complex functions over high dimensional spaces can be modeled
by neural networks that predict one dimension at a time. Specifically, we show
how Q-values and policies over continuous spaces can be modeled using a next
step prediction model over discretized dimensions. With this parameterization,
it is possible to both leverage the compositional structure of action spaces
during learning, as well as compute maxima over action spaces (approximately).
On a simple example task we demonstrate empirically that our method can perform
global search, which effectively gets around the local optimization issues that
plague DDPG. We apply the technique to off-policy (Q-learning) methods and show
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art for off-policy methods on

Abstract      = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space
to find high-performing solutions: chemists search through the space of
molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer
designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of
search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single
highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new,
fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it
provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed
throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at
each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to
choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites)
algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how
interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either
positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may
wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their
cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing,
yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single,
high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of
the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than
state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new
algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular
neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP-
Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of
interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse

science and engineering.},

Abstract      = {We present a framework that enables the discovery of diverse and
natural-looking motion strategies for athletic skills such as the high jump.
The strategies are realized as control policies for physics-based characters.
Given a task objective and an initial character configuration, the combination
of physics simulation and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) provides a suitable
starting point for automatic control policy training. To facilitate the
learning of realistic human motions, we propose a Pose Variational Autoencoder
(P-VAE) to constrain the actions to a subspace of natural poses. In contrast to
motion imitation methods, a rich variety of novel strategies can naturally
emerge by exploring initial character states through a sample-efficient
Bayesian diversity search (BDS) algorithm. A second stage of optimization that
encourages novel policies can further enrich the unique strategies discovered.
Our method allows for the discovery of diverse and novel strategies for
athletic jumping motions such as high jumps and obstacle jumps with no motion
examples and less reward engineering than prior work.},

these differences, and their effects on the underlying loss landscape, are not
well understood. In this paper, we explore the structure of neural loss
functions, and the effect of loss landscapes on generalization, using a range

method that helps us visualize loss function curvature and make meaningful
side-by-side comparisons between loss functions. Then, using a variety of

plug-and-play optimizers for the max-Q problem. Leveraging recent optimization
results for deep neural networks, we show that max-Q can be solved optimally
using mixed-integer programming (MIP). When the Q-function representation has
sufficient power, MIP-based optimization gives rise to better policies and is
more robust than approximate methods (e.g., gradient ascent, cross-entropy
search). We further develop several techniques to accelerate inference in CAQL,
which despite their approximate nature, perform well. We compare CAQL with
state-of-the-art RL algorithms on benchmark continuous-control problems that
have different degrees of action constraints and show that CAQL outperforms
policy-based methods in heavily constrained environments, often dramatically.},

experiences reuse and maximum entropy probabilistic inference model. We
evaluate SHER on Open AI Robotic manipulation tasks with sparse rewards.
Experimental results show that, in contrast to HER and its variants, our

Abstract      = {Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to solve difficult
motor control problems directly from raw sensory inputs. Their attraction is
due in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that
allow to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior
knowledge, even in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human
expert. For RL to truly make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms
and learning setups that can work across a broad range of problems with minimal
problem specific adjustments or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea
of generality in the locomotion domain. We develop a learning framework that
can learn sophisticated locomotion behavior for a wide spectrum of legged
robots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds and hexapods, including wheeled
variants. Our learning framework relies on a data-efficient, off-policy
multi-task RL algorithm and a small set of reward functions that are
semantically identical across robots. To underline the general applicability of
the method, we keep the hyper-parameter settings and reward definitions
constant across experiments and rely exclusively on on-board sensing. For nine
different types of robots, including a real-world quadruped robot, we
demonstrate that the same algorithm can rapidly learn diverse and reusable
locomotion skills without any platform specific adjustments or additional
instrumentation of the learning setup.},

small number of variables together with a good prediction error. Finally, this

Abstract      = {Learning robotic manipulation tasks using reinforcement learning with sparse
rewards is currently impractical due to the outrageous data requirements. Many
practical tasks require manipulation of multiple objects, and the complexity of
such tasks increases with the number of objects. Learning from a curriculum of
increasingly complex tasks appears to be a natural solution, but unfortunately,
does not work for many scenarios. We hypothesize that the inability of the
state-of-the-art algorithms to effectively utilize a task curriculum stems from
the absence of inductive biases for transferring knowledge from simpler to
complex tasks. We show that graph-based relational architectures overcome this
limitation and enable learning of complex tasks when provided with a simple
curriculum of tasks with increasing numbers of objects. We demonstrate the
utility of our framework on a simulated block stacking task. Starting from
scratch, our agent learns to stack six blocks into a tower. Despite using
step-wise sparse rewards, our method is orders of magnitude more data-efficient
and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method that utilizes human
demonstrations. Furthermore, the learned policy exhibits zero-shot
generalization, successfully stacking blocks into taller towers and previously
unseen configurations such as pyramids, without any further training.},

planners to bootstrap motor skills in two complex object manipulation scenarios
with different policy representations: opening a drawer with a dynamic movement
primitive representation, and closing a microwave door with a deep neural
network policy. We also show how our method can bootstrap a motor skill for the
challenging dynamic task of learning to hit a ball off a tee, where a kinematic
plan based on treating the scene as static is insufficient to solve the task,
but sufficient to bootstrap a more dynamic policy. In all three cases, our
method is competitive with human-demonstrated initialization, and significantly
outperforms starting with a random policy. This approach enables robots to to
efficiently and autonomously learn motor policies for dynamic tasks without

Abstract      = {Entropy regularization is commonly used to improve policy optimization in
reinforcement learning. It is believed to help with \emph{exploration} by
encouraging the selection of more stochastic policies. In this work, we analyze
this claim using new visualizations of the optimization landscape based on
randomly perturbing the loss function. We first show that even with access to
the exact gradient, policy optimization is difficult due to the geometry of the
objective function. Then, we qualitatively show that in some environments, a
policy with higher entropy can make the optimization landscape smoother,
thereby connecting local optima and enabling the use of larger learning rates.
This paper presents new tools for understanding the optimization landscape,
shows that policy entropy serves as a regularizer, and highlights the challenge
of designing general-purpose policy optimization algorithms.},

such that an agent, which optimizes its policy to minimize this loss, will
achieve high rewards. The loss is parametrized via temporal convolutions over
the agent's experience. Because this loss is highly flexible in its ability to
take into account the agent's history, it enables fast task learning. Empirical
results show that our evolved policy gradient algorithm (EPG) achieves faster
learning on several randomized environments compared to an off-the-shelf policy
gradient method. We also demonstrate that EPG's learned loss can generalize to
out-of-distribution test time tasks, and exhibits qualitatively different

little fine-tuning. We show that we can recover expert behavior on a variety of
continuous control tasks of the MuJoCo domain in a sample efficient manner in
terms of agent interactions and of expert interactions with the environment.
Finally, we show that the behavior of the agent we train matches the behavior

Abstract      = {Intelligent behaviour in the physical world exhibits structure at multiple
spatial and temporal scales. Although movements are ultimately executed at the
level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected
to serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations
that extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with
other agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise
of learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement,
longer-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limited
research aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams of
physically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtual
environment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and
multi-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use
of transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different
levels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control
a fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as
running and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as
dribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a
team, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of
milliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the
timescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at
different levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie
these behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from
real-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of
integrated decision-making at multiple scales in a physically embodied
multi-agent setting. See project video at https://youtu.be/KHMwq9pv7mg.},

Abstract      = {Actor-critic methods, a type of model-free Reinforcement Learning, have been
successfully applied to challenging tasks in continuous control, often
achieving state-of-the art performance. However, wide-scale adoption of these
methods in real-world domains is made difficult by their poor sample
efficiency. We address this problem both theoretically and empirically. On the
theoretical side, we identify two phenomena preventing efficient exploration in
existing state-of-the-art algorithms such as Soft Actor Critic. First,
combining a greedy actor update with a pessimistic estimate of the critic leads
to the avoidance of actions that the agent does not know about, a phenomenon we
call pessimistic underexploration. Second, current algorithms are directionally
uninformed, sampling actions with equal probability in opposite directions from
the current mean. This is wasteful, since we typically need actions taken along
certain directions much more than others. To address both of these phenomena,
we introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Actor Critic, which approximates a
lower and upper confidence bound on the state-action value function. This
allows us to apply the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to
perform directed exploration using the upper bound while still using the lower
bound to avoid overestimation. We evaluate OAC in several challenging
continuous control tasks, achieving state-of the art sample efficiency.},

simple diagonal approximations and more sophisticated factored approximations

the present work we draw inspiration from both to propose a novel approximation
that is provably better than KFAC and amendable to cheap partial updates. It
consists in tracking a diagonal variance, not in parameter coordinates, but in
a Kronecker-factored eigenbasis, in which the diagonal approximation is likely
to be more effective. Experiments show improvements over KFAC in optimization

Abstract      = {Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a range of
challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural
network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of
model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function
approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this
paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample
complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We
propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such
algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm,
which we call normalized adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the
more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation
allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and
substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks.
To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of
learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that
iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and
demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are
applicable.},

Abstract      = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters

learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing
layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of
the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training
mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some
cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant
margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the
best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Abstract      = {Continual lifelong learning requires an agent or model to learn many
sequentially ordered tasks, building on previous knowledge without

default tendency of machine learning models to catastrophically forget, yet
virtually all such work involves manually-designed solutions to the problem. We
instead advocate meta-learning a solution to catastrophic forgetting, allowing
AI to learn to continually learn. Inspired by neuromodulatory processes in the
brain, we propose A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML). It
differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an
activation-gating function that enables context-dependent selective activation
within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural
network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network
called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus
indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN.
ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it
produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning
as many as 600 classes (over 9,000 SGD updates).},

simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed
computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their
hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule
of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal
strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of
training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed
hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable
training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep
reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and
higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of
hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to
supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the
BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to
maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in
the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which
results in stable training and better final performance.},

Abstract      = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious
phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor
filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to
a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many
datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to
specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been
studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality
versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural
network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively
affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons
to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which
was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks
between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network
trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may
dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,
middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of
features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task
increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better
than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a
network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce

Abstract      = {While the recent advances in deep reinforcement learning have achieved
impressive results in learning motor skills, many of the trained policies are
only capable within a limited set of initial states. We propose a technique to
break down a complex robotic task to simpler subtasks and train them
sequentially such that the robot can expand its existing skill set gradually.
Our key idea is to build a tree of local control policies represented by neural
networks, which we refer as Relay Neural Networks. Starting from the root
policy that attempts to achieve the task from a small set of initial states,
each subsequent policy expands the set of successful initial states by driving
the new states to existing "good" states. Our algorithm utilizes the value
function of the policy to determine whether a state is "good" under each
policy. We take advantage of many existing policy search algorithms that learn
the value function simultaneously with the policy, such as those that use
actor-critic representations or those that use the advantage function to reduce
variance. We demonstrate that the relay networks can solve complex continuous
control problems for underactuated dynamic systems.},

however, it is common to carefully hand-design the reward function to encourage
a particular solution, or to derive it from demonstration data. In this paper
explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex
behavior. Specifically, we train agents in diverse environmental contexts, and
find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well
across a suite of tasks. We demonstrate this principle for locomotion --
behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We
train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and
obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a
novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents
learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without
explicit reward-based guidance. A visual depiction of highlights of the learned
behavior can be viewed following https://youtu.be/hx_bgoTF7bs .},

Abstract      = {Deep learning continues to revolutionize an ever-growing number of critical
application areas including healthcare, transportation, finance, and basic
sciences. Despite their increased predictive power, model transparency and
human explainability remain a significant challenge due to the "black box"
nature of modern deep learning models. In many cases the desired balance
between interpretability and performance is predominately task specific.
Human-centric domains such as healthcare necessitate a renewed focus on
understanding how and why these frameworks are arriving at critical and
potentially life-or-death decisions. Given the quantity of research and
empirical successes of deep learning for computer vision, most of the existing
interpretability research has focused on image processing techniques.
Comparatively, less attention has been paid to interpreting deep learning
frameworks using sequential data. Given recent deep learning advancements in
highly sequential domains such as natural language processing and physiological
signal processing, the need for deep sequential explanations is at an all-time
high. In this paper, we review current techniques for interpreting deep
learning techniques involving sequential data, identify similarities to
non-sequential methods, and discuss current limitations and future avenues of

state-dependent exploration (SDE) to current Deep RL algorithms. To enable this
adaptation, we propose two extensions to the original SDE, using more general
features and re-sampling the noise periodically, which leads to a new
exploration method generalized state-dependent exploration (gSDE). We evaluate
gSDE both in simulation, on PyBullet continuous control tasks, and directly on
three different real robots: a tendon-driven elastic robot, a quadruped and an
RC car. The noise sampling interval of gSDE permits to have a compromise

find it significantly improves prediction accuracy. We investigate several
common hypotheses, around reducing overfitting and improved representations. We

Abstract      = {While using shaped rewards can be beneficial when solving sparse reward

state, simple distance-to-goal reward shaping often fails, as it renders
learning vulnerable to local optima. We introduce a simple and effective
model-free method to learn from shaped distance-to-goal rewards on tasks where
success depends on reaching a goal state. Our method introduces an auxiliary
distance-based reward based on pairs of rollouts to encourage diverse
exploration. This approach effectively prevents learning dynamics from
stabilizing around local optima induced by the naive distance-to-goal reward
shaping and enables policies to efficiently solve sparse reward tasks. Our
augmented objective does not require any additional reward engineering or
domain expertise to implement and converges to the original sparse objective as
the agent learns to solve the task. We demonstrate that our method successfully
solves a variety of hard-exploration tasks (including maze navigation and 3D
construction in a Minecraft environment), where naive distance-based reward
shaping otherwise fails, and intrinsic curiosity and reward relabeling
strategies exhibit poor performance.},

Abstract      = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance in many
complex environments due to the integration with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
At the same time, Genetic Algorithms (GAs), often seen as a competing approach
to RL, had limited success in scaling up to the DNNs required to solve
challenging tasks. Contrary to this dichotomic view, in the physical world,
evolution and learning are complementary processes that continuously interact.
The recently proposed Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework has
demonstrated mutual benefits to performance when combining the two methods.
However, ERL has not fully addressed the scalability problem of GAs. In this
paper, we show that this problem is rooted in an unfortunate combination of a
simple genetic encoding for DNNs and the use of traditional
biologically-inspired variation operators. When applied to these encodings, the
standard operators are destructive and cause catastrophic forgetting of the
traits the networks acquired. We propose a novel algorithm called Proximal
Distilled Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (PDERL) that is characterised by
a hierarchical integration between evolution and learning. The main innovation
of PDERL is the use of learning-based variation operators that compensate for
the simplicity of the genetic representation. Unlike traditional operators, our
proposals meet the functional requirements of variation operators when applied
on directly-encoded DNNs. We evaluate PDERL in five robot locomotion settings
from the OpenAI gym. Our method outperforms ERL, as well as two
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, PPO and TD3, in all tested environments.},

Abstract      = {Several recently proposed stochastic optimization methods that have been
successfully used in training deep networks such as RMSProp, Adam, Adadelta,
Nadam are based on using gradient updates scaled by square roots of exponential
moving averages of squared past gradients. In many applications, e.g. learning
with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these
algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in
nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the
exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit
example of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to
the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous
analysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues
can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with `long-term memory' of past
gradients, and propose new variants of the Adam algorithm which not only fix
the convergence issues but often also lead to improved empirical performance.},

highly dependent on the chosen step size, which must be tediously hand-tuned in

size by performing a gradient descent on the step size itself, viewing the
whole performance of the learning trajectory as a function of step size.
Importantly, this adaptation can be computed online at little cost, without
having to iterate backward passes over the full data.},

Abstract      = {A long-term goal of AI is to produce agents that can learn a diversity of
skills throughout their lifetimes and continuously improve those skills via
experience. A longstanding obstacle towards that goal is catastrophic
forgetting, which is when learning new information erases previously learned
information. Catastrophic forgetting occurs in artificial neural networks
(ANNs), which have fueled most recent advances in AI. A recent paper proposed
that catastrophic forgetting in ANNs can be reduced by promoting modularity,
which can limit forgetting by isolating task information to specific clusters
of nodes and connections (functional modules). While the prior work did show
that modular ANNs suffered less from catastrophic forgetting, it was not able
to produce ANNs that possessed task-specific functional modules, thereby
leaving the main theory regarding modularity and forgetting untested. We
introduce diffusion-based neuromodulation, which simulates the release of
diffusing, neuromodulatory chemicals within an ANN that can modulate (i.e. up
or down regulate) learning in a spatial region. On the simple diagnostic
problem from the prior work, diffusion-based neuromodulation 1) induces
task-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections (task-specific
localized learning), which 2) produces functional modules for each subtask, and
3) yields higher performance by eliminating catastrophic forgetting. Overall,
our results suggest that diffusion-based neuromodulation promotes task-specific
localized learning and functional modularity, which can help solve the
challenging, but important problem of catastrophic forgetting.},

actual interactions are used to fill a replay buffer and the sampling ratio

replay mechanism. Typically, carefully engineered shaping rewards are required
to enable the agents to efficiently explore on high dimensional control
problems such as robotics. They are also required for model-based acceleration
methods relying on local solvers such as iLQG (e.g. Guided Policy Search and
Normalized Advantage Function). The demonstrations replace the need for
carefully engineered rewards, and reduce the exploration problem encountered by
classical RL approaches in these domains. Demonstrations are collected by a
robot kinesthetically force-controlled by a human demonstrator. Results on four
simulated insertion tasks show that DDPG from demonstrations out-performs DDPG,
and does not require engineered rewards. Finally, we demonstrate the method on
a real robotics task consisting of inserting a clip (flexible object) into a
rigid object.},

it has always been used for a specific purpose such as implementing risk-aware

control settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the
latter. We then use the distributional perspective to design a new algorithm
which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value
distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the
Arcade Learning Environment. We obtain both state-of-the-art results and
anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value distribution in
approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and

learning algorithms average over this randomness to estimate the value
function. In this paper, we build on recent work advocating a distributional
approach to reinforcement learning in which the distribution over returns is
modeled explicitly instead of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine
methods of learning the value distribution instead of the value function. We
give results that close a number of gaps between the theoretical and
algorithmic results given by Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we
extend existing results to the approximate distribution setting. Second, we
present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm consistent with
our theoretical formulation. Finally, we evaluate this new algorithm on the

Abstract      = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art
performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual

images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what
differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed
that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can
cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a
lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images
that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs
believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with
certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take
convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or
MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient
ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class.
It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs
believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call "fooling
images" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on
interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise

Abstract      = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated

tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such
methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft
actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum
entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to
maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at
the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on
this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining
off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control
benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms,
our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across
different random seeds.},

disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive
biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than 12000 models
covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible
large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that
while the different methods successfully enforce properties ``encouraged'' by
the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be
identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not
seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks.
Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be
explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision,
investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned

the deviator-actor-critic (DAC) model, which comprises three neural networks
that estimate the value function, its gradient, and determine the actor's
policy respectively. We evaluate GProp on two challenging tasks: a contextual
bandit problem constructed from nonparametric regression datasets that is
designed to probe the ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to
accurately estimate gradients; and the octopus arm, a challenging reinforcement
learning benchmark. GProp is competitive with fully supervised methods on the
bandit task and achieves the best performance to date on the octopus arm.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Exploration is a key problem in reinforcement learning, since agents can only
learn from data they acquire in the environment. With that in mind, maintaining
a population of agents is an attractive method, as it allows data be collected
with a diverse set of behaviors. This behavioral diversity is often boosted via
multi-objective loss functions. However, those approaches typically leverage
mean field updates based on pairwise distances, which makes them susceptible to
cycling behaviors and increased redundancy. In addition, explicitly boosting
diversity often has a detrimental impact on optimizing already fruitful
behaviors for rewards. As such, the reward-diversity trade off typically relies
on heuristics. Finally, such methods require behavioral representations, often
handcrafted and domain specific. In this paper, we introduce an approach to
optimize all members of a population simultaneously. Rather than using pairwise
distance, we measure the volume of the entire population in a behavioral
manifold, defined by task-agnostic behavioral embeddings. In addition, our
algorithm Diversity via Determinants (DvD), adapts the degree of diversity
during training using online learning techniques. We introduce both
evolutionary and gradient-based instantiations of DvD and show they effectively
improve exploration without reducing performance when better exploration is not
required.},

Learning (R3L). We formulate exploration as a search problem and leverage
widely-used planning algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) to
find initial solutions. These solutions are used as demonstrations to
initialize a policy, then refined by a generic RL algorithm, leading to faster
and more stable convergence. We provide theoretical guarantees of R3L
exploration finding successful solutions, as well as bounds for its sampling
complexity. We experimentally demonstrate the method outperforms classic and
intrinsic exploration techniques, requiring only a fraction of exploration
samples and achieving better asymptotic performance.},

Abstract      = {Evolution strategies (ES) are a family of black-box optimization algorithms
able to train deep neural networks roughly as well as Q-learning and policy
gradient methods on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems, but
are much faster (e.g. hours vs. days) because they parallelize better. However,
many RL problems require directed exploration because they have reward
functions that are sparse or deceptive (i.e. contain local optima), and it is
unknown how to encourage such exploration with ES. Here we show that algorithms
that have been invented to promote directed exploration in small-scale evolved
neural networks via populations of exploring agents, specifically novelty
search (NS) and quality diversity (QD) algorithms, can be hybridized with ES to
improve its performance on sparse or deceptive deep RL tasks, while retaining
scalability. Our experiments confirm that the resultant new algorithms, NS-ES
and two QD algorithms, NSR-ES and NSRA-ES, avoid local optima encountered by ES
to achieve higher performance on Atari and simulated robots learning to walk
around a deceptive trap. This paper thus introduces a family of fast, scalable
algorithms for reinforcement learning that are capable of directed exploration.
It also adds this new family of exploration algorithms to the RL toolbox and
raises the interesting possibility that analogous algorithms with multiple
simultaneous paths of exploration might also combine well with existing RL
algorithms outside ES.},

group Lasso penalty (originated in the linear regression literature) in order
to impose group-level sparsity on the network's connections, where each group
is defined as the set of outgoing weights from a unit. Depending on the
specific case, the weights can be related to an input variable, to a hidden
neuron, or to a bias unit, thus performing simultaneously all the
aforementioned tasks in order to obtain a compact network. We perform an
extensive experimental evaluation, by comparing with classical weight decay and
Lasso penalties. We show that a sparse version of the group Lasso penalty is
able to achieve competitive performances, while at the same time resulting in
extremely compact networks with a smaller number of input features. We evaluate
both on a toy dataset for handwritten digit recognition, and on multiple

Abstract      = {Many real-world control problems involve both discrete decision variables -
such as the choice of control modes, gear switching or digital outputs - as
well as continuous decision variables - such as velocity setpoints, control
gains or analogue outputs. However, when defining the corresponding optimal
control or reinforcement learning problem, it is commonly approximated with
fully continuous or fully discrete action spaces. These simplifications aim at
tailoring the problem to a particular algorithm or solver which may only
support one type of action space. Alternatively, expert heuristics are used to
remove discrete actions from an otherwise continuous space. In contrast, we
propose to treat hybrid problems in their 'native' form by solving them with
hybrid reinforcement learning, which optimizes for discrete and continuous
actions simultaneously. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed approach efficiently solves such natively hybrid reinforcement
learning problems. We then show, both in simulation and on robotic hardware,
the benefits of removing possibly imperfect expert-designed heuristics. Lastly,
hybrid reinforcement learning encourages us to rethink problem definitions. We
propose reformulating control problems, e.g. by adding meta actions, to improve
exploration or reduce mechanical wear and tear.},

Abstract      = {The promise of reinforcement learning is to solve complex sequential decision
problems autonomously by specifying a high-level reward function only. However,
reinforcement learning algorithms struggle when, as is often the case, simple
and intuitive rewards provide sparse and deceptive feedback. Avoiding these
pitfalls requires thoroughly exploring the environment, but creating algorithms
that can do so remains one of the central challenges of the field. We
hypothesise that the main impediment to effective exploration originates from
algorithms forgetting how to reach previously visited states ("detachment") and
from failing to first return to a state before exploring from it
("derailment"). We introduce Go-Explore, a family of algorithms that addresses
these two challenges directly through the simple principles of explicitly
remembering promising states and first returning to such states before
intentionally exploring. Go-Explore solves all heretofore unsolved Atari games
and surpasses the state of the art on all hard-exploration games, with orders
of magnitude improvements on the grand challenges Montezuma's Revenge and
Pitfall. We also demonstrate the practical potential of Go-Explore on a
sparse-reward pick-and-place robotics task. Additionally, we show that adding a
goal-conditioned policy can further improve Go-Explore's exploration efficiency
and enable it to handle stochasticity throughout training. The substantial
performance gains from Go-Explore suggest that the simple principles of
remembering states, returning to them, and exploring from them are a powerful
and general approach to exploration, an insight that may prove critical to the
creation of truly intelligent learning agents.},

designed to have an algorithmic cost close to backpropagation through time for
sparsely connected networks. We use this procedure on gated leaky neural
networks (GLNNs), a variant of recurrent neural networks with an architecture
inspired by finite automata and an evolution equation inspired by
continuous-time networks. GLNNs trained with a Riemannian gradient are
demonstrated to effectively capture a variety of structures in synthetic

of natural languages, but difficult to learn), intersections of multiple
independent Markov-type relations, or long-distance relationships such as the

high-reward states and the probable trajectories leading to them. To this end,
we advocate for the use of a backtracking model that predicts the preceding
states that terminate at a given high-reward state. We can train a model which,
starting from a high value state (or one that is estimated to have high value),
predicts and sample for which the (state, action)-tuples may have led to that
high value state. These traces of (state, action) pairs, which we refer to as
Recall Traces, sampled from this backtracking model starting from a high value
state, are informative as they terminate in good states, and hence we can use
these traces to improve a policy. We provide a variational interpretation for
this idea and a practical algorithm in which the backtracking model samples
from an approximate posterior distribution over trajectories which lead to
large rewards. Our method improves the sample efficiency of both on- and
off-policy RL algorithms across several environments and tasks.},

develop an algorithm which permits stable deep Q-learning for continuous

Abstract      = {While supervised learning has enabled great progress in many applications,
unsupervised learning has not seen such widespread adoption, and remains an
important and challenging endeavor for artificial intelligence. In this work,
we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful
representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive
Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such
representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful
autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces
the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict
future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling.
While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a
particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful
representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech,
images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

Abstract      = {We study the Wasserstein natural gradient in parametric statistical models
with continuous sample spaces. Our approach is to pull back the
$L^2$-Wasserstein metric tensor in the probability density space to a parameter
space, equipping the latter with a positive definite metric tensor, under which
it becomes a Riemannian manifold, named the Wasserstein statistical manifold.
In general, it is not a totally geodesic sub-manifold of the density space, and
therefore its geodesics will differ from the Wasserstein geodesics, except for
the well-known Gaussian distribution case, a fact which can also be validated
under our framework. We use the sub-manifold geometry to derive a gradient flow
and natural gradient descent method in the parameter space. When parametrized
densities lie in $\bR$, the induced metric tensor establishes an explicit
formula. In optimization problems, we observe that the natural gradient descent
outperforms the standard gradient descent when the Wasserstein distance is the
objective function. In such a case, we prove that the resulting algorithm
behaves similarly to the Newton method in the asymptotic regime. The proof
calculates the exact Hessian formula for the Wasserstein distance, which
further motivates another preconditioner for the optimization process. To the
end, we present examples to illustrate the effectiveness of the natural
gradient in several parametric statistical models, including the Gaussian
measure, Gaussian mixture, Gamma distribution, and Laplace distribution.},

control scheme that provides high-probability safety guarantees throughout the
learning process. Based on a reliable statistical model, we construct provably
accurate confidence intervals on predicted trajectories. Unlike previous
approaches, we allow for input-dependent uncertainties. Based on these reliable
predictions, we guarantee that trajectories satisfy safety constraints.
Moreover, we use a terminal set constraint to recursively guarantee the
existence of safe control actions at every iteration. We evaluate the resulting
algorithm to safely explore the dynamics of an inverted pendulum and to solve a
reinforcement learning task on a cart-pole system with safety constraints.},

"elite hypervolume" whose shape is defined by their common features. In this
paper, we first introduce the elite hypervolume concept and propose two metrics
to characterize it: the genotypic spread and the genotypic similarity. We then
introduce a new variation operator, called "directional variation", that
exploits interspecies (or inter-elites) correlations to accelerate the
MAP-Elites algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this operator in
three problems (a toy function, a redundant robotic arm, and a hexapod robot).},

behavior priors that capture the common movement and interaction patterns that
are shared across a set of related tasks or contexts. For example the day-to
day behavior of humans comprises distinctive locomotion and manipulation
patterns that recur across many different situations and goals. We discuss how
such behavior patterns can be captured using probabilistic trajectory models
and how these can be integrated effectively into reinforcement learning
schemes, e.g.\ to facilitate multi-task and transfer learning. We then extend
these ideas to latent variable models and consider a formulation to learn
hierarchical priors that capture different aspects of the behavior in reusable
modules. We discuss how such latent variable formulations connect to related
work on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and mutual information and
curiosity based objectives, thereby offering an alternative perspective on
existing ideas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by applying

this framework to model discrete sequences, and then further explore different

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning requires manual specification of a reward function to
learn a task. While in principle this reward function only needs to specify the
task goal, in practice reinforcement learning can be very time-consuming or
even infeasible unless the reward function is shaped so as to provide a smooth
gradient towards a successful outcome. This shaping is difficult to specify by
hand, particularly when the task is learned from raw observations, such as
images. In this paper, we study how we can automatically learn dynamical
distances: a measure of the expected number of time steps to reach a given goal
state from any other state. These dynamical distances can be used to provide
well-shaped reward functions for reaching new goals, making it possible to
learn complex tasks efficiently. We show that dynamical distances can be used
in a semi-supervised regime, where unsupervised interaction with the
environment is used to learn the dynamical distances, while a small amount of
preference supervision is used to determine the task goal, without any manually
engineered reward function or goal examples. We evaluate our method both on a
real-world robot and in simulation. We show that our method can learn to turn a

Abstract      = {COVID-19 is a global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. T cells
play a key role in the adaptive antiviral immune response by killing infected
cells and facilitating the selection of virus-specific antibodies. However
neither the dynamics and cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell
response nor the diversity of resulting immune memory are well understood. In
this study we use longitudinal high-throughput T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing
to track changes in the T cell repertoire following two mild cases of COVID-19.
In both donors we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal
expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of CD8+ TCR sequences to
SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and presence in
large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic
motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential
occurence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires
from COVID-19 patients. We show that in both donors the majority of
infection-reactive clonotypes acquire memory phenotypes. Certain T cell clones
were detected in the memory fraction at the pre-infection timepoint, suggesting
participation of pre-existing cross-reactive memory T cells in the immune
response to SARS-CoV-2.},

entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be
superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014
English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,
including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French
translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art
BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction
of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the
Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to
English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Abstract      = {Long-horizon planning in realistic environments requires the ability to
reason over sequential tasks in high-dimensional state spaces with complex
dynamics. Classical motion planning algorithms, such as rapidly-exploring
random trees, are capable of efficiently exploring large state spaces and
computing long-horizon, sequential plans. However, these algorithms are
generally challenged with complex, stochastic, and high-dimensional state
spaces as well as in the presence of narrow passages, which naturally emerge in
tasks that interact with the environment. Machine learning offers a promising
solution for its ability to learn general policies that can handle complex
interactions and high-dimensional observations. However, these policies are
generally limited in horizon length. Our approach, Broadly-Exploring,
Local-policy Trees (BELT), merges these two approaches to leverage the
strengths of both through a task-conditioned, model-based tree search. BELT
uses an RRT-inspired tree search to efficiently explore the state space.
Locally, the exploration is guided by a task-conditioned, learned policy
capable of performing general short-horizon tasks. This task space can be quite
general and abstract; its only requirements are to be sampleable and to
well-cover the space of useful tasks. This search is aided by a
task-conditioned model that temporally extends dynamics propagation to allow
long-horizon search and sequential reasoning over tasks. BELT is demonstrated
experimentally to be able to plan long-horizon, sequential trajectories with a
goal conditioned policy and generate plans that are robust.},

Abstract      = {We present Residual Policy Learning (RPL): a simple method for improving

thrives in complex robotic manipulation tasks where good but imperfect

remains data-inefficient or intractable, but learning a residual on top of the
initial controller can yield substantial improvements. We study RPL in six
challenging MuJoCo tasks involving partial observability, sensor noise, model
misspecification, and controller miscalibration. For initial controllers, we
consider both hand-designed policies and model-predictive controllers with
known or learned transition models. By combining learning with control
algorithms, RPL can perform long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks for which
reinforcement learning alone fails. Moreover, we find that RPL consistently and
substantially improves on the initial controllers. We argue that RPL is a
promising approach for combining the complementary strengths of deep
reinforcement learning and robotic control, pushing the boundaries of what
either can achieve independently. Video and code at

satisfy a set of multi-step pathwise consistencies along any path. Thus,
Trust-PCL is able to maintain optimization stability while exploiting

Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), a highly relevant $\mathcal{NP}$-Complete

algorithm in which edges (embedded with their weights) communicate with
vertices for a number of iterations after which the model is asked to decide
whether a route with cost $<C$ exists. We show that such a network can be
trained with sets of dual examples: given the optimal tour cost $C^{*}$, we
produce one decision instance with target cost $x\%$ smaller and one with
target cost $x\%$ larger than $C^{*}$. We were able to obtain $80\%$ accuracy
training with $-2\%,+2\%$ deviations, and the same trained model can generalize
for more relaxed deviations with increasing performance. We also show that the
model is capable of generalizing for larger problem sizes. Finally, we provide
a method for predicting the optimal route cost within $2\%$ deviation from the

However, the high dimensionality of the state space often means that it is
impractical to generate sufficient training data with real-world experiments.
As an alternative solution, we propose to learn a robot controller in
simulation, with the potential of then transferring this to a real robot.
Building upon the recent success of deep Q-networks, we present an approach
which uses 3D simulations to train a 7-DOF robotic arm in a control task
without any prior knowledge. The controller accepts images of the environment
as its only input, and outputs motor actions for the task of locating and
grasping a cube, over a range of initial configurations. To encourage efficient
learning, a structured reward function is designed with intermediate rewards.
We also present preliminary results in direct transfer of policies over to a
real robot, without any further training.},

automated HPO, which we demonstrate to yield significantly improved performance
compared to human experts. In addition, we show that tuning of several MBRL
hyperparameters dynamically, i.e. during the training itself, further improves
the performance compared to using static hyperparameters which are kept fixed

the effects of several hyperparameters, such as plan horizon or learning rate

matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the
Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized
Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain
properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to
have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural
gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions

the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a
thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient
descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex
quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used "empirical" approximation of

Abstract      = {How quickly can a given class of concepts be learned from examples? It is
common to measure the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm by
plotting its "learning curve", that is, the decay of the error rate as a
function of the number of training examples. However, the classical theoretical
framework for understanding learnability, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis
and Valiant, does not explain the behavior of learning curves: the
distribution-free PAC model of learning can only bound the upper envelope of
the learning curves over all possible data distributions. This does not match
the practice of machine learning, where the data source is typically fixed in
any given scenario, while the learner may choose the number of training
examples on the basis of factors such as computational resources and desired
accuracy.
  In this paper, we study an alternative learning model that better captures
such practical aspects of machine learning, but still gives rise to a complete
theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely, we
consider the problem of universal learning, which aims to understand the
performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution, but without
requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this paper is a
remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of universal
learning. More precisely, we show that the learning curves of any given concept
class decay either at an exponential, linear, or arbitrarily slow rates.
Moreover, each of these cases is completely characterized by appropriate
combinatorial parameters, and we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that
achieve the best possible rate in each case.
  For concreteness, we consider in this paper only the realizable case, though
analogous results are expected to extend to more general learning scenarios.},

Abstract      = {Discrete-action algorithms have been central to numerous recent successes of
deep reinforcement learning. However, applying these algorithms to
high-dimensional action tasks requires tackling the combinatorial increase of
the number of possible actions with the number of action dimensions. This
problem is further exacerbated for continuous-action tasks that require fine
control of actions via discretization. In this paper, we propose a novel neural
architecture featuring a shared decision module followed by several network
branches, one for each action dimension. This approach achieves a linear
increase of the number of network outputs with the number of degrees of freedom
by allowing a level of independence for each individual action dimension. To
illustrate the approach, we present a novel agent, called Branching Dueling
Q-Network (BDQ), as a branching variant of the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network
(Dueling DDQN). We evaluate the performance of our agent on a set of
challenging continuous control tasks. The empirical results show that the
proposed agent scales gracefully to environments with increasing action
dimensionality and indicate the significance of the shared decision module in
coordination of the distributed action branches. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed agent performs competitively against a state-of-the-art continuous
control algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).},

Abstract      = {In this paper we introduce deep Gaussian process (GP) models. Deep GPs are a
deep belief network based on Gaussian process mappings. The data is modeled as
the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then
governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or
the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM). We perform inference in the model by
approximate variational marginalization. This results in a strict lower bound
on the marginal likelihood of the model which we use for model selection
(number of layers and nodes per layer). Deep belief networks are typically
applied to relatively large data sets using stochastic gradient descent for
optimization. Our fully Bayesian treatment allows for the application of deep
models even when data is scarce. Model selection by our variational bound shows
that a five layer hierarchy is justified even when modelling a digit data set
containing only 150 examples.},

dynamically, generalizing the agent to many more tasks while at the same time
achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, MuZero uses internal state
representations derived from real environment states for its predictions. In
this paper, we bind the model's predicted internal state representation to the
environment state via two additional terms: a reconstruction model loss and a
simpler consistency loss, both of which work independently and unsupervised,
acting as constraints to stabilize the learning process. Our experiments show
that this new integration of reconstruction model loss and simpler consistency
loss provide a significant performance increase in OpenAI Gym environments. Our
modifications also enable self-supervised pretraining for MuZero, so the
algorithm can learn about environment dynamics before a goal is made available.},

rollouts of a stable dynamical system, which, under a change of coordinates
defined by a diffeomorphism, is equivalent to a simple, hand-specified
dynamical system. As an immediate result of using diffeomorphisms, the
stability property of the hand-specified dynamical system directly carry over
to the learned dynamical system. Inspired by recent works in density
estimation, we propose to represent the diffeomorphism as a composition of
simple parameterized diffeomorphisms. Additional structure is imposed to
provide guarantees on the smoothness of the generated motions. The efficacy of
this approach is demonstrated through validation on an established benchmark as

require adding additional moving parts and hyperparameters on top of a base RL

Abstract      = {Acquiring a diverse repertoire of general-purpose skills remains an open
challenge for robotics. In this work, we propose self-supervising control on
top of human teleoperated play data as a way to scale up skill learning. Play
has two properties that make it attractive compared to conventional task
demonstrations. Play is cheap, as it can be collected in large quantities
quickly without task segmenting, labeling, or resetting to an initial state.
Play is naturally rich, covering ~4x more interaction space than task
demonstrations for the same amount of collection time. To learn control from
play, we introduce Play-LMP, a self-supervised method that learns to organize
play behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to achieve
specific goals. Combining self-supervised control with a diverse play dataset
shifts the focus of skill learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to
the full continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find that this
combination generalizes well empirically---after self-supervising on unlabeled
play, our method substantially outperforms individual expert-trained policies
on 18 difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a simulated robotic
tabletop environment. We additionally find that play-supervised models, unlike
their expert-trained counterparts, are more robust to perturbations and exhibit
retrying-till-success behaviors. Finally, we find that our agent organizes its
latent plan space around functional tasks, despite never being trained with
task labels. Videos, code and data are available at

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique to train an agent to perform a

Such an approach does not scale well to settings in which an agent needs to
perform a diverse set of tasks, such as navigating to varying positions in a
room or moving objects to varying locations. Instead, we propose a method that
allows an agent to automatically discover the range of tasks that it is capable
of performing. We use a generator network to propose tasks for the agent to try
to achieve, specified as goal states. The generator network is optimized using
adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level
of difficulty for the agent. Our method thus automatically produces a
curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn. We show that, by using this
framework, an agent can efficiently and automatically learn to perform a wide

method can also learn to achieve tasks with sparse rewards, which traditionally

Abstract      = {A major challenge in reinforcement learning is the design of exploration
strategies, especially for environments with sparse reward structures and
continuous state and action spaces. Intuitively, if the reinforcement signal is
very scarce, the agent should rely on some form of short-term memory in order

based on two intuitions: (1) the choice of the next exploratory action should
depend not only on the (Markovian) state of the environment, but also on the
agent's trajectory so far, and (2) the agent should utilize a measure of spread
in the state space to avoid getting stuck in a small region. Our method
leverages concepts often used in statistical physics to provide explanations
for the behavior of simplified (polymer) chains in order to generate persistent
(locally self-avoiding) trajectories in state space. We discuss the theoretical
properties of locally self-avoiding walks and their ability to provide a kind
of short-term memory through a decaying temporal correlation within the

state occupancy from any given state and the reward predictor maps states to
scalar rewards. The value function of a state can be computed as the inner
product between the successor map and the reward weights. In this paper, we
present DSR, which generalizes SR within an end-to-end deep reinforcement
learning framework. DSR has several appealing properties including: increased
sensitivity to distal reward changes due to factorization of reward and world
dynamics, and the ability to extract bottleneck states (subgoals) given
successor maps trained under a random policy. We show the efficacy of our

Abstract      = {We address the problem of learning hierarchical deep neural network policies

cripple lower layers of a hierarchy to force them to use higher-level
modulating signals, each layer in our framework is trained to directly solve
the task, but acquires a range of diverse strategies via a maximum entropy
reinforcement learning objective. Each layer is also augmented with latent
random variables, which are sampled from a prior distribution during the
training of that layer. The maximum entropy objective causes these latent
variables to be incorporated into the layer's policy, and the higher level
layer can directly control the behavior of the lower layer through this latent
space. Furthermore, by constraining the mapping from latent variables to
actions to be invertible, higher layers retain full expressivity: neither the
higher layers nor the lower layers are constrained in their behavior. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can improve on the performance of
single-layer policies on standard benchmark tasks simply by adding additional
layers, and that our method can solve more complex sparse-reward tasks by
learning higher-level policies on top of high-entropy skills optimized for
simple low-level objectives.},

goal-reaching behaviors from scratch. Each iteration, the agent collects new
trajectories using the latest policy, and maximizes the likelihood of the
actions along these trajectories under the goal that was actually reached, so
as to improve the policy. We formally show that this iterated supervised

bounds of the learned policy, and empirically demonstrate improved

Abstract      = {We introduce an exploration bonus for deep reinforcement learning methods
that is easy to implement and adds minimal overhead to the computation
performed. The bonus is the error of a neural network predicting features of
the observations given by a fixed randomly initialized neural network. We also
introduce a method to flexibly combine intrinsic and extrinsic rewards. We find
that the random network distillation (RND) bonus combined with this increased
flexibility enables significant progress on several hard exploration Atari
games. In particular we establish state of the art performance on Montezuma's
Revenge, a game famously difficult for deep reinforcement learning methods. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that achieves better than
average human performance on this game without using demonstrations or having
access to the underlying state of the game, and occasionally completes the
first level.},

Abstract      = {Designing effective model-based reinforcement learning algorithms is
difficult because the ease of data generation must be weighed against the bias
of model-generated data. In this paper, we study the role of model usage in
policy optimization both theoretically and empirically. We first formulate and
analyze a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm with a guarantee of
monotonic improvement at each step. In practice, this analysis is overly
pessimistic and suggests that real off-policy data is always preferable to
model-generated on-policy data, but we show that an empirical estimate of model
generalization can be incorporated into such analysis to justify model usage.
Motivated by this analysis, we then demonstrate that a simple procedure of
using short model-generated rollouts branched from real data has the benefits
of more complicated model-based algorithms without the usual pitfalls. In
particular, this approach surpasses the sample efficiency of prior model-based
methods, matches the asymptotic performance of the best model-free algorithms,
and scales to horizons that cause other model-based methods to fail entirely.},

difficulties due to possible discontinuities in the Hamiltonian of the optimal

that it can be applied to a general class of target hitting continuous dynamic
games with nonlinear dynamics, and has very good properties in terms of its
numerical solution, since the value function and the Hamiltonian of the system
are both continuous. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by
applying it to a two aircraft collision avoidance scenario under target window
constraints and in the presence of wind disturbance. Target Windows are a novel
concept in air traffic management, and represent spatial and temporal
constraints, that the aircraft have to respect to meet their schedule.},

Abstract      = {Recent breakthroughs in the reinforcement learning (RL) community have made
significant advances towards learning and deploying policies on real world
robotic systems. However, even with the current state-of-the-art algorithms and
computational resources, these algorithms are still plagued with high sample
complexity, and thus long training times, especially for high degree of freedom
(DOF) systems. There are also concerns arising from lack of perceived stability
or robustness guarantees from emerging policies. This paper aims at mitigating
these drawbacks by: (1) modeling a complex, high DOF system with a
representative simple one, (2) making explicit use of forward and inverse
kinematics without forcing the RL algorithm to "learn" them on its own, and (3)
learning locomotion policies in Cartesian space instead of joint space. In this
paper these methods are applied to JPL's Robosimian, but can be readily used on
any system with a base and end effector(s). These locomotion policies can be
produced in just a few minutes, trained on a single laptop. We compare the
robustness of the resulting learned policies to those of other control methods.

we also demonstrate how trajectory optimization can be used to perform
temporally coordinated exploration in conjunction with estimating uncertainty
in value function approximation. This exploration is critical for fast and

Abstract      = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have recently achieved remarkable
successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in
methods for training large deep networks. However, these methods usually
require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for
real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good
representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better
policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality
helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL
algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet)
that uses neural nets to produce good representations to be used as inputs to
deep RL algorithms. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually
supposed to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL
agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation
than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger
feature propagation together with larger networks (and thus larger search
space) allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus
improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the
proposed method outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms
of both sample efficiency and performance. Codes for the proposed method are

Abstract      = {We present a canonical way to turn any smooth parametric family of
probability distributions on an arbitrary search space $X$ into a
continuous-time black-box optimization method on $X$, the
\emph{information-geometric optimization} (IGO) method. Invariance as a design
principle minimizes the number of arbitrary choices. The resulting \emph{IGO
flow} conducts the natural gradient ascent of an adaptive, time-dependent,
quantile-based transformation of the objective function. It makes no
assumptions on the objective function to be optimized.
  The IGO method produces explicit IGO algorithms through time discretization.
It naturally recovers versions of known algorithms and offers a systematic way
to derive new ones. The cross-entropy method is recovered in a particular case,
and can be extended into a smoothed, parametrization-independent maximum
likelihood update (IGO-ML). For Gaussian distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, IGO
is related to natural evolution strategies (NES) and recovers a version of the
CMA-ES algorithm. For Bernoulli distributions on $\{0,1\}^d$, we recover the
PBIL algorithm. From restricted Boltzmann machines, we obtain a novel algorithm
for optimization on $\{0,1\}^d$. All these algorithms are unified under a
single information-geometric optimization framework.
  Thanks to its intrinsic formulation, the IGO method achieves invariance under
reparametrization of the search space $X$, under a change of parameters of the
probability distributions, and under increasing transformations of the
objective function.
  Theory strongly suggests that IGO algorithms have minimal loss in diversity
during optimization, provided the initial diversity is high. First experiments
using restricted Boltzmann machines confirm this insight. Thus IGO seems to
provide, from information theory, an elegant way to spontaneously explore
several valleys of a fitness landscape in a single run.},

Abstract      = {Adversarial Imitation Learning alternates between learning a discriminator --
which tells apart expert's demonstrations from generated ones -- and a
generator's policy to produce trajectories that can fool this discriminator.
This alternated optimization is known to be delicate in practice since it
compounds unstable adversarial training with brittle and sample-inefficient
reinforcement learning. We propose to remove the burden of the policy
optimization steps by leveraging a novel discriminator formulation.
Specifically, our discriminator is explicitly conditioned on two policies: the
one from the previous generator's iteration and a learnable policy. When
optimized, this discriminator directly learns the optimal generator's policy.
Consequently, our discriminator's update solves the generator's optimization
problem for free: learning a policy that imitates the expert does not require
an additional optimization loop. This formulation effectively cuts by half the
implementation and computational burden of Adversarial Imitation Learning
algorithms by removing the Reinforcement Learning phase altogether. We show on
a variety of tasks that our simpler approach is competitive to prevalent
Imitation Learning methods.},

Abstract      = {In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning
algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is
specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in
high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be
asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster
than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT*
algorithm performs a "lazy" dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined
number of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves
steadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As a departure from previous analysis
approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT*
algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra
mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate
bounds--the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning.
Specifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration
spaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order $O(n^{-1/d+\rho})$, where
$n$ is the number of sampled points, $d$ is the dimension of the configuration
space, and $\rho$ is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate
asymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the
configuration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length,
and when connections are made based on the number of nearest neighbors instead
of a fixed connection radius. Numerical experiments over a range of dimensions
and obstacle configurations confirm our theoretical and heuristic arguments by
showing that FMT*, for a given execution time, returns substantially better
solutions than either PRM* or RRT*, especially in high-dimensional
configuration spaces and in scenarios where collision-checking is expensive.},

Abstract      = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the
prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for
large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts
struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a
tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods
have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex
models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one
method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a
unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular
prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class
of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing
there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties.
The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent
methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights
from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational
performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous
approaches.},

Abstract      = {Background Precise prediction of cancer types is vital for cancer diagnosis
and therapy. Important cancer marker genes can be inferred through predictive
model. Several studies have attempted to build machine learning models for this
task however none has taken into consideration the effects of tissue of origin
that can potentially bias the identification of cancer markers. Results In this
paper, we introduced several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that
take unstructured gene expression inputs to classify tumor and non-tumor
samples into their designated cancer types or as normal. Based on different
designs of gene embeddings and convolution schemes, we implemented three CNN
models: 1D-CNN, 2D-Vanilla-CNN, and 2D-Hybrid-CNN. The models were trained and
tested on combined 10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and 731 matched normal
tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our models achieved excellent
prediction accuracies (93.9-95.0%) among 34 classes (33 cancers and normal).
Furthermore, we interpreted one of the models, known as 1D-CNN model, with a
guided saliency technique and identified a total of 2,090 cancer markers (108
per class). The concordance of differential expression of these markers between
the cancer type they represent and others is confirmed. In breast cancer, for
instance, our model identified well-known markers, such as GATA3 and ESR1.
Finally, we extended the 1D-CNN model for prediction of breast cancer subtypes
and achieved an average accuracy of 88.42% among 5 subtypes. The codes can be

Abstract      = {We propose a reinforcement learning agent to solve hard exploration games by
learning a range of directed exploratory policies. We construct an episodic
memory-based intrinsic reward using k-nearest neighbors over the agent's recent
experience to train the directed exploratory policies, thereby encouraging the
agent to repeatedly revisit all states in its environment. A self-supervised
inverse dynamics model is used to train the embeddings of the nearest neighbour
lookup, biasing the novelty signal towards what the agent can control. We
employ the framework of Universal Value Function Approximators (UVFA) to
simultaneously learn many directed exploration policies with the same neural
network, with different trade-offs between exploration and exploitation. By
using the same neural network for different degrees of
exploration/exploitation, transfer is demonstrated from predominantly
exploratory policies yielding effective exploitative policies. The proposed
method can be incorporated to run with modern distributed RL agents that
collect large amounts of experience from many actors running in parallel on
separate environment instances. Our method doubles the performance of the base
agent in all hard exploration in the Atari-57 suite while maintaining a very
high score across the remaining games, obtaining a median human normalised
score of 1344.0%. Notably, the proposed method is the first algorithm to
achieve non-zero rewards (with a mean score of 8,400) in the game of Pitfall!

Abstract      = {In this work we create agents that can perform well beyond a single,
individual task, that exhibit much wider generalisation of behaviour to a
massive, rich space of challenges. We define a universe of tasks within an
environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are
generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is
natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and
independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D
worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges
posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent
is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement
between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a
singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being
incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing
an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task
distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning,
we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able
to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with
behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks.
Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and
Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks
we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent
heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use,
option switching, and cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate that the general
capabilities of this agent could unlock larger scale transfer of behaviour
through cheap finetuning.},

connects averaged SGD and natural gradient, both of which are arguably optimal

reducing the effective damping coefficient for second-order optimization. Our

poorly when the interaction time with the environment is limited, as is the

entropy policies trained using soft Q-learning can be applied to real-world
robotic manipulation. The application of this method to real-world manipulation
is facilitated by two important features of soft Q-learning. First, soft
Q-learning can learn multimodal exploration strategies by learning policies
represented by expressive energy-based models. Second, we show that policies
learned with soft Q-learning can be composed to create new policies, and that
the optimality of the resulting policy can be bounded in terms of the
divergence between the composed policies. This compositionality provides an
especially valuable tool for real-world manipulation, where constructing new
policies by composing existing skills can provide a large gain in efficiency
over training from scratch. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that soft
Q-learning is substantially more sample efficient than prior model-free deep
reinforcement learning methods, and that compositionality can be performed for
both simulated and real-world tasks.},

Abstract      = {Policy gradient methods are an appealing approach in reinforcement learning
because they directly optimize the cumulative reward and can straightforwardly

main challenges are the large number of samples typically required, and the
difficulty of obtaining stable and steady improvement despite the
nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using
value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient
estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of
the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second
challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and
the value function, which are represented by neural networks.
  Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D
locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated
robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting
out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses
hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly
from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and
the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds

invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein
metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler
divergence, does not possess the third. We provide empirical evidence
suggesting that this is a serious issue in practice. Leveraging insights from
probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric,
the Cram\'er distance. We show that the Cram\'er distance possesses all three
desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler

we design a new algorithm, the Cram\'er Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),
