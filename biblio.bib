Abstract      = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or
convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best
performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention
mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based
solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions
entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be
superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly
less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014
English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results,
including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French
translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art
BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction
of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the
Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to
English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Abstract      = {Many relevant tasks require an agent to reach a certain state, or to
manipulate objects into a desired configuration. For example, we might want a
robot to align and assemble a gear onto an axle or insert and turn a key in a
lock. These goal-oriented tasks present a considerable challenge for
reinforcement learning, since their natural reward function is sparse and
prohibitive amounts of exploration are required to reach the goal and receive
some learning signal. Past approaches tackle these problems by exploiting
expert demonstrations or by manually designing a task-specific reward shaping
function to guide the learning agent. Instead, we propose a method to learn
these tasks without requiring any prior knowledge other than obtaining a single
state in which the task is achieved. The robot is trained in reverse, gradually
learning to reach the goal from a set of start states increasingly far from the
goal. Our method automatically generates a curriculum of start states that
adapts to the agent's performance, leading to efficient training on
goal-oriented tasks. We demonstrate our approach on difficult simulated
navigation and fine-grained manipulation problems, not solvable by
state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods.},

Abstract      = {Effective exploration is critical for reinforcement learning agents in

Recent works based on state-visitation counts, curiosity and
entropy-maximization generate intrinsic reward signals to motivate the agent to
visit novel states for exploration. However, the agent can get distracted by
perturbations to sensor inputs that contain novel but task-irrelevant
information, e.g. due to sensor noise or changing background. In this work, we
introduce the sequential information bottleneck objective for learning
compressed and temporally coherent representations by modelling and compressing
sequential predictive information in time-series observations. For efficient
exploration in noisy environments, we further construct intrinsic rewards that
capture task-relevant state novelty based on the learned representations. We
derive a variational upper bound of our sequential information bottleneck
objective for practical optimization and provide an information-theoretic
interpretation of the derived upper bound. Our experiments on a set of
challenging image-based simulated control tasks show that our method achieves
better sample efficiency, and robustness to both white noise and natural video

Abstract      = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance in many
complex environments due to the integration with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).
At the same time, Genetic Algorithms (GAs), often seen as a competing approach
to RL, had limited success in scaling up to the DNNs required to solve
challenging tasks. Contrary to this dichotomic view, in the physical world,
evolution and learning are complementary processes that continuously interact.
The recently proposed Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (ERL) framework has
demonstrated mutual benefits to performance when combining the two methods.
However, ERL has not fully addressed the scalability problem of GAs. In this
paper, we show that this problem is rooted in an unfortunate combination of a
simple genetic encoding for DNNs and the use of traditional
biologically-inspired variation operators. When applied to these encodings, the
standard operators are destructive and cause catastrophic forgetting of the
traits the networks acquired. We propose a novel algorithm called Proximal
Distilled Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning (PDERL) that is characterised by
a hierarchical integration between evolution and learning. The main innovation
of PDERL is the use of learning-based variation operators that compensate for
the simplicity of the genetic representation. Unlike traditional operators, our
proposals meet the functional requirements of variation operators when applied
on directly-encoded DNNs. We evaluate PDERL in five robot locomotion settings
from the OpenAI gym. Our method outperforms ERL, as well as two
state-of-the-art RL algorithms, PPO and TD3, in all tested environments.},

multi-stage training scheme that includes different training stages for
different objectives. After multi-stage training, the policy can be directly
transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. Training on different tasks and
exploring more diverse scenarios lead to highly robust policies that can
exploit the diverse set of learned maneuvers to recover from perturbations or
poor landings during real-world deployment. Such robustness in the proposed
policy enables Cassie to succeed in completing a variety of challenging jump
tasks in the real world, such as standing long jumps, jumping onto elevated

Abstract      = {Recent breakthroughs in the reinforcement learning (RL) community have made
significant advances towards learning and deploying policies on real world
robotic systems. However, even with the current state-of-the-art algorithms and
computational resources, these algorithms are still plagued with high sample
complexity, and thus long training times, especially for high degree of freedom
(DOF) systems. There are also concerns arising from lack of perceived stability
or robustness guarantees from emerging policies. This paper aims at mitigating
these drawbacks by: (1) modeling a complex, high DOF system with a
representative simple one, (2) making explicit use of forward and inverse
kinematics without forcing the RL algorithm to "learn" them on its own, and (3)
learning locomotion policies in Cartesian space instead of joint space. In this
paper these methods are applied to JPL's Robosimian, but can be readily used on
any system with a base and end effector(s). These locomotion policies can be
produced in just a few minutes, trained on a single laptop. We compare the
robustness of the resulting learned policies to those of other control methods.

Abstract      = {Imitation learning (IL) enables robots to acquire skills quickly by
transferring expert knowledge, which is widely adopted in reinforcement

planning tasks, a challenging problem in deploying IL and RL methods is how to
generate and collect massive, broadly distributed data such that these methods
can generalize effectively. In this work, we solve this problem using our
proposed approach called {self-imitation learning by planning (SILP)}, where
demonstration data are collected automatically by planning on the visited
states from the current policy. SILP is inspired by the observation that
successfully visited states in the early reinforcement learning stage are
collision-free nodes in the graph-search based motion planner, so we can plan
and relabel robot's own trials as demonstrations for policy learning. Due to
these self-generated demonstrations, we relieve the human operator from the
laborious data preparation process required by IL and RL methods in solving
complex motion planning tasks. The evaluation results show that our SILP method
achieves higher success rates and enhances sample efficiency compared to
selected baselines, and the policy learned in simulation performs well in a
real-world placement task with changing goals and obstacles.},

IDAAC decouples the optimization of the policy and value function, using
separate networks to model them. Second, it introduces an auxiliary loss which
encourages the representation to be invariant to task-irrelevant properties of
the environment. IDAAC shows good generalization to unseen environments,
achieving a new state-of-the-art on the Procgen benchmark and outperforming

the dynamics of the environment from the rewards, and "generalized policy
improvement", a generalization of dynamic programming's policy improvement
operation that considers a set of policies rather than a single one. Put
together, the two ideas lead to an approach that integrates seamlessly within
the reinforcement learning framework and allows the free exchange of
information across tasks. The proposed method also provides performance
guarantees for the transferred policy even before any learning has taken place.
We derive two theorems that set our approach in firm theoretical ground and

Abstract      = {Self-supervised goal proposal and reaching is a key component for exploration

without access to any oracle goal sampling distribution requires deep

dynamics-aware manifold of reachable states. For a goal, our proposed method
deterministically visits a state at the current frontier of reachable states
(commitment/reaching) and then stochastically explores to reach the goal
(exploration). This allocates exploration budget near the frontier of the
reachable region instead of its interior. We target the challenging problem of
policy learning from initial and goal states specified as images, and do not
assume any access to the underlying ground-truth states of the robot and the
environment. To keep track of reachable latent states, we propose a
distance-conditioned reachability network that is trained to infer whether one
state is reachable from another within the specified latent space distance.

Abstract      = {We address the longstanding challenge of producing flexible, realistic
humanoid character controllers that can perform diverse whole-body tasks
involving object interactions. This challenge is central to a variety of
fields, from graphics and animation to robotics and motor neuroscience. Our
physics-based environment uses realistic actuation and first-person perception
-- including touch sensors and egocentric vision -- with a view to producing
active-sensing behaviors (e.g. gaze direction), transferability to real robots,
and comparisons to the biology. We develop an integrated neural-network based
approach consisting of a motor primitive module, human demonstrations, and an
instructed reinforcement learning regime with curricula and task variations. We
demonstrate the utility of our approach for several tasks, including
goal-conditioned box carrying and ball catching, and we characterize its
behavioral robustness. The resulting controllers can be deployed in real-time
on a standard PC. See overview video, https://youtu.be/2rQAW-8gQQk .},

Abstract      = {In many environments only a tiny subset of all states yield high reward. In
these cases, few of the interactions with the environment provide a relevant
learning signal. Hence, we may want to preferentially train on those
high-reward states and the probable trajectories leading to them. To this end,
we advocate for the use of a backtracking model that predicts the preceding
states that terminate at a given high-reward state. We can train a model which,
starting from a high value state (or one that is estimated to have high value),
predicts and sample for which the (state, action)-tuples may have led to that
high value state. These traces of (state, action) pairs, which we refer to as
Recall Traces, sampled from this backtracking model starting from a high value
state, are informative as they terminate in good states, and hence we can use
these traces to improve a policy. We provide a variational interpretation for
this idea and a practical algorithm in which the backtracking model samples
from an approximate posterior distribution over trajectories which lead to
large rewards. Our method improves the sample efficiency of both on- and
off-policy RL algorithms across several environments and tasks.},

Abstract      = {Complex models in physics, biology, economics, and engineering are often
sloppy, meaning that the model parameters are not well determined by the model
predictions for collective behavior. Many parameter combinations can vary over
decades without significant changes in the predictions. This review uses
information geometry to explore sloppiness and its deep relation to emergent
theories. We introduce the model manifold of predictions, whose coordinates are
the model parameters. Its hyperribbon structure explains why only a few
parameter combinations matter for the behavior. We review recent rigorous
results that connect the hierarchy of hyperribbon widths to approximation
theory, and to the smoothness of model predictions under changes of the control
variables. We discuss recent geodesic methods to find simpler models on nearby
boundaries of the model manifold -- emergent theories with fewer parameters
that explain the behavior equally well. We discuss a Bayesian prior which
optimizes the mutual information between model parameters and experimental
data, naturally favoring points on the emergent boundary theories and thus
simpler models. We introduce a `projected maximum likelihood' prior that
efficiently approximates this optimal prior, and contrast both to the poor
behavior of the traditional Jeffreys prior. We discuss the way the
renormalization group coarse-graining in statistical mechanics introduces a
flow of the model manifold, and connect stiff and sloppy directions along the
model manifold with relevant and irrelevant eigendirections of the
renormalization group. Finally, we discuss recently developed `intensive'
embedding methods, allowing one to visualize the predictions of arbitrary
probabilistic models as low-dimensional projections of an isometric embedding,

Abstract      = {Much like humans, robots should have the ability to leverage knowledge from
previously learned tasks in order to learn new tasks quickly in new and

focused on learning a single task, from scratch, with a limited notion of

more efficiently. One possible solution is meta-learning, but many of the
related approaches are limited in their ability to scale to a large number of
tasks and to learn further tasks without forgetting previously learned ones.
With this in mind, we introduce Task-Embedded Control Networks, which employ
ideas from metric learning in order to create a task embedding that can be used
by a robot to learn new tasks from one or more demonstrations. In the area of
visually-guided manipulation, we present simulation results in which we surpass
the performance of a state-of-the-art method when using only visual information
from each demonstration. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can
also be used in conjunction with domain randomisation to train our few-shot

to its intrinsic hierarchical process. We propose a novel decision-making
framework for TAMP by constructing an extended decision tree for both symbolic
task planning and high-dimension motion variable binding. We integrate top-k
planning for generating explicitly a skeleton space where a variety of
candidate skeleton plans are at disposal. Moreover, we effectively combine this
skeleton space with the resultant motion variable spaces into a single extended
decision space. Accordingly, we use Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to ensure an
exploration-exploitation balance at each decision node and optimize globally to
produce optimal solutions. The proposed seamless combination of symbolic top-k
planning with streams, with the proved optimality of MCTS, leads to a powerful
planning algorithm that can handle the combinatorial complexity of long-horizon

differentiates through a sequential learning process to meta-learn an
activation-gating function that enables context-dependent selective activation
within a deep neural network. Specifically, a neuromodulatory (NM) neural
network gates the forward pass of another (otherwise normal) neural network
called the prediction learning network (PLN). The NM network also thus
indirectly controls selective plasticity (i.e. the backward pass of) the PLN.
ANML enables continual learning without catastrophic forgetting at scale: it
produces state-of-the-art continual learning performance, sequentially learning

datasets, these methods require significant additional machinery to select the
appropriate motion for the character to track in a given scenario. In this
work, we propose to obviate the need to manually design imitation objectives
and mechanisms for motion selection by utilizing a fully automated approach
based on adversarial imitation learning. High-level task objectives that the
character should perform can be specified by relatively simple reward
functions, while the low-level style of the character's behaviors can be
specified by a dataset of unstructured motion clips, without any explicit clip
selection or sequencing. These motion clips are used to train an adversarial
motion prior, which specifies style-rewards for training the character through
reinforcement learning (RL). The adversarial RL procedure automatically selects
which motion to perform, dynamically interpolating and generalizing from the
dataset. Our system produces high-quality motions that are comparable to those
achieved by state-of-the-art tracking-based techniques, while also being able
to easily accommodate large datasets of unstructured motion clips. Composition
of disparate skills emerges automatically from the motion prior, without
requiring a high-level motion planner or other task-specific annotations of the
motion clips. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on a diverse
cast of complex simulated characters and a challenging suite of motor control
tasks.},

Abstract      = {Reliable and stable locomotion has been one of the most fundamental
challenges for legged robots. Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has emerged
as a promising method for developing such control policies autonomously. In
this paper, we develop a system for learning legged locomotion policies with
deep RL in the real world with minimal human effort. The key difficulties for
on-robot learning systems are automatic data collection and safety. We overcome
these two challenges by developing a multi-task learning procedure and a
safety-constrained RL framework. We tested our system on the task of learning
to walk on three different terrains: flat ground, a soft mattress, and a
doormat with crevices. Our system can automatically and efficiently learn
locomotion skills on a Minitaur robot with little human intervention. The

Abstract      = {Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to solve difficult
motor control problems directly from raw sensory inputs. Their attraction is
due in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that
allow to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior
knowledge, even in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human
expert. For RL to truly make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms
and learning setups that can work across a broad range of problems with minimal
problem specific adjustments or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea
of generality in the locomotion domain. We develop a learning framework that
can learn sophisticated locomotion behavior for a wide spectrum of legged
robots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds and hexapods, including wheeled
variants. Our learning framework relies on a data-efficient, off-policy
multi-task RL algorithm and a small set of reward functions that are
semantically identical across robots. To underline the general applicability of
the method, we keep the hyper-parameter settings and reward definitions
constant across experiments and rely exclusively on on-board sensing. For nine
different types of robots, including a real-world quadruped robot, we
demonstrate that the same algorithm can rapidly learn diverse and reusable
locomotion skills without any platform specific adjustments or additional
instrumentation of the learning setup.},

Abstract      = {Learning a robot motor skill from scratch is impractically slow; so much so
that in practice, learning must be bootstrapped using a good skill policy
obtained from human demonstration. However, relying on human demonstration
necessarily degrades the autonomy of robots that must learn a wide variety of
skills over their operational lifetimes. We propose using kinematic motion
planning as a completely autonomous, sample efficient way to bootstrap motor
skill learning for object manipulation. We demonstrate the use of motion
planners to bootstrap motor skills in two complex object manipulation scenarios
with different policy representations: opening a drawer with a dynamic movement
primitive representation, and closing a microwave door with a deep neural
network policy. We also show how our method can bootstrap a motor skill for the
challenging dynamic task of learning to hit a ball off a tee, where a kinematic
plan based on treating the scene as static is insufficient to solve the task,
but sufficient to bootstrap a more dynamic policy. In all three cases, our
method is competitive with human-demonstrated initialization, and significantly
outperforms starting with a random policy. This approach enables robots to to
efficiently and autonomously learn motor policies for dynamic tasks without
human demonstration.},

Diversity-regularized Collaborative Exploration (DiCE). DiCE utilizes a group

collected experiences. A regularization mechanism is further designed to
maintain the diversity of the team and modulate the exploration. We implement

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning (RL) is typically concerned with estimating stationary
policies or single-step models, leveraging the Markov property to factorize
problems in time. However, we can also view RL as a generic sequence modeling
problem, with the goal being to produce a sequence of actions that leads to a
sequence of high rewards. Viewed in this way, it is tempting to consider
whether high-capacity sequence prediction models that work well in other
domains, such as natural-language processing, can also provide effective
solutions to the RL problem. To this end, we explore how RL can be tackled with
the tools of sequence modeling, using a Transformer architecture to model
distributions over trajectories and repurposing beam search as a planning
algorithm. Framing RL as sequence modeling problem simplifies a range of design
decisions, allowing us to dispense with many of the components common in
offline RL algorithms. We demonstrate the flexibility of this approach across
long-horizon dynamics prediction, imitation learning, goal-conditioned RL, and
offline RL. Further, we show that this approach can be combined with existing
model-free algorithms to yield a state-of-the-art planner in sparse-reward,

Abstract      = {Model-based algorithms, which learn a dynamics model from logged experience

emerged as a promising paradigm for offline reinforcement learning (offline

explicit uncertainty quantification for incorporating pessimism. Uncertainty
estimation with complex models, such as deep neural networks, can be difficult
and unreliable. We overcome this limitation by developing a new model-based
offline RL algorithm, COMBO, that regularizes the value function on
out-of-support state-action tuples generated via rollouts under the learned
model. This results in a conservative estimate of the value function for
out-of-support state-action tuples, without requiring explicit uncertainty
estimation. We theoretically show that our method optimizes a lower bound on
the true policy value, that this bound is tighter than that of prior methods,
and our approach satisfies a policy improvement guarantee in the offline
setting. Through experiments, we find that COMBO consistently performs as well
or better as compared to prior offline model-free and model-based methods on
widely studied offline RL benchmarks, including image-based tasks.},

Abstract      = {Model-based planning is often thought to be necessary for deep, careful
reasoning and generalization in artificial agents. While recent successes of
model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with deep function approximation have
strengthened this hypothesis, the resulting diversity of model-based methods
has also made it difficult to track which components drive success and why. In
this paper, we seek to disentangle the contributions of recent methods by
focusing on three questions: (1) How does planning benefit MBRL agents? (2)
Within planning, what choices drive performance? (3) To what extent does
planning improve generalization? To answer these questions, we study the
performance of MuZero (Schrittwieser et al., 2019), a state-of-the-art MBRL
algorithm with strong connections and overlapping components with many other
MBRL algorithms. We perform a number of interventions and ablations of MuZero
across a wide range of environments, including control tasks, Atari, and 9x9
Go. Our results suggest the following: (1) Planning is most useful in the
learning process, both for policy updates and for providing a more useful data
distribution. (2) Using shallow trees with simple Monte-Carlo rollouts is as
performant as more complex methods, except in the most difficult reasoning
tasks. (3) Planning alone is insufficient to drive strong generalization. These
results indicate where and how to utilize planning in reinforcement learning
settings, and highlight a number of open questions for future MBRL research.},

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning algorithms use correlations between policies and
rewards to improve agent performance. But in dynamic or sparsely rewarding
environments these correlations are often too small, or rewarding events are
too infrequent to make learning feasible. Human education instead relies on
curricula--the breakdown of tasks into simpler, static challenges with dense
rewards--to build up to complex behaviors. While curricula are also useful for
artificial agents, hand-crafting them is time consuming. This has lead
researchers to explore automatic curriculum generation. Here we explore
automatic curriculum generation in rich, dynamic environments. Using a
setter-solver paradigm we show the importance of considering goal validity,
goal feasibility, and goal coverage to construct useful curricula. We
demonstrate the success of our approach in rich but sparsely rewarding 2D and
3D environments, where an agent is tasked to achieve a single goal selected
from a set of possible goals that varies between episodes, and identify
challenges for future work. Finally, we demonstrate the value of a novel
technique that guides agents towards a desired goal distribution. Altogether,
these results represent a substantial step towards applying automatic task
curricula to learn complex, otherwise unlearnable goals, and to our knowledge
are the first to demonstrate automated curriculum generation for
goal-conditioned agents in environments where the possible goals vary between

Abstract      = {In reinforcement learning, pre-trained low-level skills have the potential to
greatly facilitate exploration. However, prior knowledge of the downstream task
is required to strike the right balance between generality (fine-grained
control) and specificity (faster learning) in skill design. In previous work on

addressed explicitly, as locomotion provides a suitable prior for navigation
tasks, which have been of foremost interest. In this work, we analyze this
trade-off for low-level policy pre-training with a new benchmark suite of
diverse, sparse-reward tasks for bipedal robots. We alleviate the need for
prior knowledge by proposing a hierarchical skill learning framework that
acquires skills of varying complexity in an unsupervised manner. For
utilization on downstream tasks, we present a three-layered hierarchical
learning algorithm to automatically trade off between general and specific
skills as required by the respective task. In our experiments, we show that our

Abstract      = {Actor-critic methods, a type of model-free Reinforcement Learning, have been
successfully applied to challenging tasks in continuous control, often
achieving state-of-the art performance. However, wide-scale adoption of these
methods in real-world domains is made difficult by their poor sample
efficiency. We address this problem both theoretically and empirically. On the
theoretical side, we identify two phenomena preventing efficient exploration in
existing state-of-the-art algorithms such as Soft Actor Critic. First,
combining a greedy actor update with a pessimistic estimate of the critic leads
to the avoidance of actions that the agent does not know about, a phenomenon we
call pessimistic underexploration. Second, current algorithms are directionally
uninformed, sampling actions with equal probability in opposite directions from
the current mean. This is wasteful, since we typically need actions taken along
certain directions much more than others. To address both of these phenomena,
we introduce a new algorithm, Optimistic Actor Critic, which approximates a
lower and upper confidence bound on the state-action value function. This
allows us to apply the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to
perform directed exploration using the upper bound while still using the lower
bound to avoid overestimation. We evaluate OAC in several challenging
continuous control tasks, achieving state-of the art sample efficiency.},

Abstract      = {Offline Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown potent in many safe-critical
tasks in robotics where exploration is risky and expensive. However, it still
struggles to acquire skills in temporally extended tasks. In this paper, we
study the problem of offline RL for temporally extended tasks. We propose a
hierarchical planning framework, consisting of a low-level goal-conditioned RL
policy and a high-level goal planner. The low-level policy is trained via
offline RL. We improve the offline training to deal with out-of-distribution
goals by a perturbed goal sampling process. The high-level planner selects
intermediate sub-goals by taking advantages of model-based planning methods. It
plans over future sub-goal sequences based on the learned value function of the
low-level policy. We adopt a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to sample
meaningful high-dimensional sub-goal candidates and to solve the high-level
long-term strategy optimization problem. We evaluate our proposed method in
long-horizon driving and robot navigation tasks. Experiments show that our
method outperforms baselines with different hierarchical designs and other
regular planners without hierarchy in these complex tasks.},

Abstract      = {Hierarchical agents have the potential to solve sequential decision making
tasks with greater sample efficiency than their non-hierarchical counterparts
because hierarchical agents can break down tasks into sets of subtasks that
only require short sequences of decisions. In order to realize this potential
of faster learning, hierarchical agents need to be able to learn their multiple
levels of policies in parallel so these simpler subproblems can be solved
simultaneously. Yet, learning multiple levels of policies in parallel is hard
because it is inherently unstable: changes in a policy at one level of the
hierarchy may cause changes in the transition and reward functions at higher
levels in the hierarchy, making it difficult to jointly learn multiple levels
of policies. In this paper, we introduce a new Hierarchical Reinforcement
Learning (HRL) framework, Hierarchical Actor-Critic (HAC), that can overcome
the instability issues that arise when agents try to jointly learn multiple
levels of policies. The main idea behind HAC is to train each level of the
hierarchy independently of the lower levels by training each level as if the
lower level policies are already optimal. We demonstrate experimentally in both
grid world and simulated robotics domains that our approach can significantly
accelerate learning relative to other non-hierarchical and hierarchical
methods. Indeed, our framework is the first to successfully learn 3-level
hierarchies in parallel in tasks with continuous state and action spaces.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Exploration is a key problem in reinforcement learning, since agents can only
learn from data they acquire in the environment. With that in mind, maintaining
a population of agents is an attractive method, as it allows data be collected
with a diverse set of behaviors. This behavioral diversity is often boosted via
multi-objective loss functions. However, those approaches typically leverage
mean field updates based on pairwise distances, which makes them susceptible to
cycling behaviors and increased redundancy. In addition, explicitly boosting
diversity often has a detrimental impact on optimizing already fruitful
behaviors for rewards. As such, the reward-diversity trade off typically relies
on heuristics. Finally, such methods require behavioral representations, often
handcrafted and domain specific. In this paper, we introduce an approach to
optimize all members of a population simultaneously. Rather than using pairwise
distance, we measure the volume of the entire population in a behavioral
manifold, defined by task-agnostic behavioral embeddings. In addition, our
algorithm Diversity via Determinants (DvD), adapts the degree of diversity
during training using online learning techniques. We introduce both
evolutionary and gradient-based instantiations of DvD and show they effectively
improve exploration without reducing performance when better exploration is not
required.},

goal is an algorithm that utilizes only simple and convergent maximum

Our proposed approach, which we refer to as advantage-weighted regression
(AWR), consists of two standard supervised learning steps: one to regress onto
target values for a value function, and another to regress onto weighted target
actions for the policy. The method is simple and general, can accommodate
continuous and discrete actions, and can be implemented in just a few lines of
code on top of standard supervised learning methods. We provide a theoretical
motivation for AWR and analyze its properties when incorporating off-policy
data from experience replay. We evaluate AWR on a suite of standard OpenAI Gym
benchmark tasks, and show that it achieves competitive performance compared to
a number of well-established state-of-the-art RL algorithms. AWR is also able
to acquire more effective policies than most off-policy algorithms when
learning from purely static datasets with no additional environmental
interactions. Furthermore, we demonstrate our algorithm on challenging
continuous control tasks with highly complex simulated characters.},

Abstract      = {Unsupervised representation learning has succeeded with excellent results in
many applications. It is an especially powerful tool to learn a good
representation of environments with partial or noisy observations. In partially
observable domains it is important for the representation to encode a belief
state, a sufficient statistic of the observations seen so far. In this paper,
we investigate whether it is possible to learn such a belief representation
using modern neural architectures. Specifically, we focus on one-step frame
prediction and two variants of contrastive predictive coding (CPC) as the
objective functions to learn the representations. To evaluate these learned
representations, we test how well they can predict various pieces of
information about the underlying state of the environment, e.g., position of
the agent in a 3D maze. We show that all three methods are able to learn belief
representations of the environment, they encode not only the state information,
but also its uncertainty, a crucial aspect of belief states. We also find that
for CPC multi-step predictions and action-conditioning are critical for
accurate belief representations in visually complex environments. The ability
of neural representations to capture the belief information has the potential
to spur new advances for learning and planning in partially observable domains,
where leveraging uncertainty is essential for optimal decision making.},

Abstract      = {We introduce the "NoBackTrack" algorithm to train the parameters of dynamical
systems such as recurrent neural networks. This algorithm works in an online,
memoryless setting, thus requiring no backpropagation through time, and is
scalable, avoiding the large computational and memory cost of maintaining the
full gradient of the current state with respect to the parameters.
  The algorithm essentially maintains, at each time, a single search direction
in parameter space. The evolution of this search direction is partly stochastic
and is constructed in such a way to provide, at every time, an unbiased random
estimate of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.
Because the gradient estimate is unbiased, on average over time the parameter
is updated as it should.
  The resulting gradient estimate can then be fed to a lightweight Kalman-like
filter to yield an improved algorithm. For recurrent neural networks, the
resulting algorithms scale linearly with the number of parameters.
  Small-scale experiments confirm the suitability of the approach, showing that
the stochastic approximation of the gradient introduced in the algorithm is not
detrimental to learning. In particular, the Kalman-like version of NoBackTrack
is superior to backpropagation through time (BPTT) when the time span of
dependencies in the data is longer than the truncation span for BPTT.},

adding a behavior cloning term to the policy update of an online RL algorithm

In both donors we identified CD4+ and CD8+ T cell clones with transient clonal
expansion after infection. The antigen specificity of CD8+ TCR sequences to
SARS-CoV-2 epitopes was confirmed by both MHC tetramer binding and presence in
large database of SARS-CoV-2 epitope-specific TCRs. We describe characteristic
motifs in TCR sequences of COVID-19-reactive clones and show preferential
occurence of these motifs in publicly available large dataset of repertoires

Abstract      = {Skill-based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising strategy
to leverage prior knowledge for accelerated robot learning. Skills are
typically extracted from expert demonstrations and are embedded into a latent
space from which they can be sampled as actions by a high-level RL agent.
However, this skill space is expansive, and not all skills are relevant for a
given robot state, making exploration difficult. Furthermore, the downstream RL
agent is limited to learning structurally similar tasks to those used to
construct the skill space. We firstly propose accelerating exploration in the
skill space using state-conditioned generative models to directly bias the
high-level agent towards only sampling skills relevant to a given state based
on prior experience. Next, we propose a low-level residual policy for
fine-grained skill adaptation enabling downstream RL agents to adapt to unseen
task variations. Finally, we validate our approach across four challenging
manipulation tasks that differ from those used to build the skill space,
demonstrating our ability to learn across task variations while significantly
accelerating exploration, outperforming prior works. Code and videos are

Abstract      = {In reinforcement learning (RL), it is easier to solve a task if given a good
representation. While deep RL should automatically acquire such good
representations, prior work often finds that learning representations in an
end-to-end fashion is unstable and instead equip RL algorithms with additional
representation learning parts (e.g., auxiliary losses, data augmentation). How
can we design RL algorithms that directly acquire good representations? In this
paper, instead of adding representation learning parts to an existing RL
algorithm, we show (contrastive) representation learning methods can be cast as
RL algorithms in their own right. To do this, we build upon prior work and
apply contrastive representation learning to action-labeled trajectories, in
such a way that the (inner product of) learned representations exactly
corresponds to a goal-conditioned value function. We use this idea to
reinterpret a prior RL method as performing contrastive learning, and then use
the idea to propose a much simpler method that achieves similar performance.
Across a range of goal-conditioned RL tasks, we demonstrate that contrastive RL
methods achieve higher success rates than prior non-contrastive methods,
including in the offline RL setting. We also show that contrastive RL
outperforms prior methods on image-based tasks, without using data augmentation
or auxiliary objectives.},

Controllability-aware Skill Discovery (CSD), which actively seeks complex,

controllability-aware distance function, which assigns larger values to state
transitions that are harder to achieve with the current skills. Combined with
distance-maximizing skill discovery, CSD progressively learns more challenging
skills over the course of training as our jointly trained distance function
reduces rewards for easy-to-achieve skills. Our experimental results in six
robotic manipulation and locomotion environments demonstrate that CSD can
discover diverse complex skills including object manipulation and locomotion
skills with no supervision, significantly outperforming prior unsupervised

matrix acting as a substitute for the Hessian. In many important cases, the
Fisher information matrix is shown to be equivalent to the Generalized
Gauss-Newton matrix, which both approximates the Hessian, but also has certain
properties that favor its use over the Hessian. This perspective turns out to
have significant implications for the design of a practical and robust natural
gradient optimizer, as it motivates the use of techniques like trust regions
and Tikhonov regularization. Additionally, we make a series of contributions to
the understanding of natural gradient and 2nd-order methods, including: a
thorough analysis of the convergence speed of stochastic natural gradient
descent (and more general stochastic 2nd-order methods) as applied to convex
quadratics, a critical examination of the oft-used "empirical" approximation of

approach learns from passive data by modeling intentions: measuring how the
likelihood of future outcomes change when the agent acts to achieve a
particular task. We propose a temporal difference learning objective to learn
about intentions, resulting in an algorithm similar to conventional RL, but
which learns entirely from passive data. When optimizing this objective, our
agent simultaneously learns representations of states, of policies, and of
possible outcomes in an environment, all from raw observational data. Both
theoretically and empirically, this scheme learns features amenable for value
prediction for downstream tasks, and our experiments demonstrate the ability to
learn from many forms of passive data, including cross-embodiment video data

challenging due to sample inefficiency. Consequently, the success of DRL in
robotics has thus far been limited to simpler manipulators and tasks. In this
work, we show that model-free DRL can effectively scale up to complex
manipulation tasks with a high-dimensional 24-DoF hand, and solve them from
scratch in simulated experiments. Furthermore, with the use of a small number
of human demonstrations, the sample complexity can be significantly reduced,

disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive
biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than 12000 models
covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible
large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that
while the different methods successfully enforce properties ``encouraged'' by
the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be
identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not
seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks.
Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be
explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision,
investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned
representations, and consider a reproducible experimental setup covering

Abstract      = {While neuroevolution (evolving neural networks) has a successful track record
across a variety of domains from reinforcement learning to artificial life, it
is rarely applied to large, deep neural networks. A central reason is that
while random mutation generally works in low dimensions, a random perturbation
of thousands or millions of weights is likely to break existing functionality,
providing no learning signal even if some individual weight changes were
beneficial. This paper proposes a solution by introducing a family of safe
mutation (SM) operators that aim within the mutation operator itself to find a
degree of change that does not alter network behavior too much, but still
facilitates exploration. Importantly, these SM operators do not require any
additional interactions with the environment. The most effective SM variant
capitalizes on the intriguing opportunity to scale the degree of mutation of
each individual weight according to the sensitivity of the network's outputs to
that weight, which requires computing the gradient of outputs with respect to
the weights (instead of the gradient of error, as in conventional deep
learning). This safe mutation through gradients (SM-G) operator dramatically
increases the ability of a simple genetic algorithm-based neuroevolution method
to find solutions in high-dimensional domains that require deep and/or
recurrent neural networks (which tend to be particularly brittle to mutation),
including domains that require processing raw pixels. By improving our ability
to evolve deep neural networks, this new safer approach to mutation expands the

reaching policies from scratch, without the need for expert demonstrations or a
value function. In lieu of demonstrations, we leverage the property that any
trajectory is a successful demonstration for reaching the final state in that
same trajectory. We propose a simple algorithm in which an agent continually
relabels and imitates the trajectories it generates to progressively learn
goal-reaching behaviors from scratch. Each iteration, the agent collects new
trajectories using the latest policy, and maximizes the likelihood of the
actions along these trajectories under the goal that was actually reached, so
as to improve the policy. We formally show that this iterated supervised
learning procedure optimizes a bound on the RL objective, derive performance
bounds of the learned policy, and empirically demonstrate improved
goal-reaching performance and robustness over current RL algorithms in several

Abstract      = {We identify two issues with the family of algorithms based on the Adversarial
Imitation Learning framework. The first problem is implicit bias present in the
reward functions used in these algorithms. While these biases might work well
for some environments, they can also lead to sub-optimal behavior in others.
Secondly, even though these algorithms can learn from few expert
demonstrations, they require a prohibitively large number of interactions with
the environment in order to imitate the expert for many real-world
applications. In order to address these issues, we propose a new algorithm
called Discriminator-Actor-Critic that uses off-policy Reinforcement Learning
to reduce policy-environment interaction sample complexity by an average factor
of 10. Furthermore, since our reward function is designed to be unbiased, we
can apply our algorithm to many problems without making any task-specific
adjustments.},

Abstract      = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the
distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters
of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower
learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously
hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this
phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing
layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of
the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training
mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and
be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some
cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image
classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14
times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant
margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the
best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9% top-5
validation error (and 4.8% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

Abstract      = {A long-term goal of reinforcement learning is to design agents that can
autonomously interact and learn in the world. A critical challenge to such
autonomy is the presence of irreversible states which require external
assistance to recover from, such as when a robot arm has pushed an object off
of a table. While standard agents require constant monitoring to decide when to
intervene, we aim to design proactive agents that can request human
intervention only when needed. To this end, we propose an algorithm that
efficiently learns to detect and avoid states that are irreversible, and
proactively asks for help in case the agent does enter them. On a suite of
continuous control environments with unknown irreversible states, we find that
our algorithm exhibits better sample- and intervention-efficiency compared to
existing methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract      = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successful in various domains like
robotics, game playing, and simulation. While RL agents have shown impressive
capabilities in their specific tasks, they insufficiently adapt to new tasks.
In supervised learning, this adaptation problem is addressed by large-scale
pre-training followed by fine-tuning to new down-stream tasks. Recently,
pre-training on multiple tasks has been gaining traction in RL. However,
fine-tuning a pre-trained model often suffers from catastrophic forgetting,
that is, the performance on the pre-training tasks deteriorates when
fine-tuning on new tasks. To investigate the catastrophic forgetting
phenomenon, we first jointly pre-train a model on datasets from two benchmark
suites, namely Meta-World and DMControl. Then, we evaluate and compare a
variety of fine-tuning methods prevalent in natural language processing, both
in terms of performance on new tasks, and how well performance on pre-training
tasks is retained. Our study shows that with most fine-tuning approaches, the
performance on pre-training tasks deteriorates significantly. Therefore, we
propose a novel method, Learning-to-Modulate (L2M), that avoids the degradation
of learned skills by modulating the information flow of the frozen pre-trained
model via a learnable modulation pool. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the Continual-World benchmark, while retaining performance on
the pre-training tasks. Finally, to aid future research in this area, we
release a dataset encompassing 50 Meta-World and 16 DMControl tasks.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {A grand challenge in reinforcement learning is intelligent exploration,
especially when rewards are sparse or deceptive. Two Atari games serve as
benchmarks for such hard-exploration domains: Montezuma's Revenge and Pitfall.
On both games, current RL algorithms perform poorly, even those with intrinsic
motivation, which is the dominant method to improve performance on
hard-exploration domains. To address this shortfall, we introduce a new
algorithm called Go-Explore. It exploits the following principles: (1) remember
previously visited states, (2) first return to a promising state (without
exploration), then explore from it, and (3) solve simulated environments
through any available means (including by introducing determinism), then
robustify via imitation learning. The combined effect of these principles is a
dramatic performance improvement on hard-exploration problems. On Montezuma's
Revenge, Go-Explore scores a mean of over 43k points, almost 4 times the
previous state of the art. Go-Explore can also harness human-provided domain
knowledge and, when augmented with it, scores a mean of over 650k points on
Montezuma's Revenge. Its max performance of nearly 18 million surpasses the
human world record, meeting even the strictest definition of "superhuman"
performance. On Pitfall, Go-Explore with domain knowledge is the first
algorithm to score above zero. Its mean score of almost 60k points exceeds
expert human performance. Because Go-Explore produces high-performing
demonstrations automatically and cheaply, it also outperforms imitation
learning work where humans provide solution demonstrations. Go-Explore opens up
many new research directions into improving it and weaving its insights into
current RL algorithms. It may also enable progress on previously unsolvable
hard-exploration problems in many domains, especially those that harness a
simulator during training (e.g. robotics).},

results for deep neural networks, we show that max-Q can be solved optimally
using mixed-integer programming (MIP). When the Q-function representation has
sufficient power, MIP-based optimization gives rise to better policies and is
more robust than approximate methods (e.g., gradient ascent, cross-entropy
search). We further develop several techniques to accelerate inference in CAQL,
which despite their approximate nature, perform well. We compare CAQL with
state-of-the-art RL algorithms on benchmark continuous-control problems that
have different degrees of action constraints and show that CAQL outperforms

providing only instantaneous proprioceptive observations. By combining original
termination conditions and policy smoothness conditioning, we achieve stable

Abstract      = {We address the problem of learning hierarchical deep neural network policies
for reinforcement learning. In contrast to methods that explicitly restrict or
cripple lower layers of a hierarchy to force them to use higher-level
modulating signals, each layer in our framework is trained to directly solve
the task, but acquires a range of diverse strategies via a maximum entropy
reinforcement learning objective. Each layer is also augmented with latent
random variables, which are sampled from a prior distribution during the
training of that layer. The maximum entropy objective causes these latent
variables to be incorporated into the layer's policy, and the higher level
layer can directly control the behavior of the lower layer through this latent
space. Furthermore, by constraining the mapping from latent variables to
actions to be invertible, higher layers retain full expressivity: neither the
higher layers nor the lower layers are constrained in their behavior. Our
experimental evaluation demonstrates that we can improve on the performance of
single-layer policies on standard benchmark tasks simply by adding additional
layers, and that our method can solve more complex sparse-reward tasks by
learning higher-level policies on top of high-entropy skills optimized for
simple low-level objectives.},

produce one decision instance with target cost $x\%$ smaller and one with
target cost $x\%$ larger than $C^{*}$. We were able to obtain $80\%$ accuracy
training with $-2\%,+2\%$ deviations, and the same trained model can generalize

Abstract      = {Learning robust value functions given raw observations and rewards is now
possible with model-free and model-based deep reinforcement learning
algorithms. There is a third alternative, called Successor Representations
(SR), which decomposes the value function into two components -- a reward
predictor and a successor map. The successor map represents the expected future
state occupancy from any given state and the reward predictor maps states to
scalar rewards. The value function of a state can be computed as the inner
product between the successor map and the reward weights. In this paper, we
present DSR, which generalizes SR within an end-to-end deep reinforcement
learning framework. DSR has several appealing properties including: increased
sensitivity to distal reward changes due to factorization of reward and world
dynamics, and the ability to extract bottleneck states (subgoals) given
successor maps trained under a random policy. We show the efficacy of our
approach on two diverse environments given raw pixel observations -- simple
grid-world domains (MazeBase) and the Doom game engine.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning can enable complex, adaptive behavior to be learned
automatically for autonomous robotic platforms. However, practical deployment
of reinforcement learning methods must contend with the fact that the training
process itself can be unsafe for the robot. In this paper, we consider the
specific case of a mobile robot learning to navigate an a priori unknown
environment while avoiding collisions. In order to learn collision avoidance,
the robot must experience collisions at training time. However, high-speed
collisions, even at training time, could damage the robot. A successful
learning method must therefore proceed cautiously, experiencing only low-speed
collisions until it gains confidence. To this end, we present an
uncertainty-aware model-based learning algorithm that estimates the probability
of collision together with a statistical estimate of uncertainty. By
formulating an uncertainty-dependent cost function, we show that the algorithm
naturally chooses to proceed cautiously in unfamiliar environments, and
increases the velocity of the robot in settings where it has high confidence.
Our predictive model is based on bootstrapped neural networks using dropout,
allowing it to process raw sensory inputs from high-bandwidth sensors such as
cameras. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively
minimizes dangerous collisions at training time in an obstacle avoidance task
for a simulated and real-world quadrotor, and a real-world RC car. Videos of

the compact latent space of a powerful world model. The world model uses
discrete representations and is trained separately from the policy. DreamerV2
constitutes the first agent that achieves human-level performance on the Atari

model. With the same computational budget and wall-clock time, Dreamer V2
reaches 200M frames and surpasses the final performance of the top single-GPU

affording transparency: models equipped with attention provide a distribution

as communicating the relative importance of inputs. However, it is unclear what
relationship exists between attention weights and model outputs. In this work,
we perform extensive experiments across a variety of NLP tasks that aim to
assess the degree to which attention weights provide meaningful `explanations'
for predictions. We find that they largely do not. For example, learned
attention weights are frequently uncorrelated with gradient-based measures of
feature importance, and one can identify very different attention distributions
that nonetheless yield equivalent predictions. Our findings show that standard
attention modules do not provide meaningful explanations and should not be
treated as though they do. Code for all experiments is available at

enables posterior sampling for structured and efficient exploration. We
demonstrate how to integrate these task variables with off-policy RL algorithms

namely the ability to generalise to unseen tasks. Parametric generalisation
relies on the interpolation power of a function approximator that is given the
task description as input; one of its most common form are universal value
function approximators (UVFAs). Another way to generalise to new tasks is to
exploit structure in the RL problem itself. Generalised policy improvement
(GPI) combines solutions of previous tasks into a policy for the unseen task;
this relies on instantaneous policy evaluation of old policies under the new
reward function, which is made possible through successor features (SFs). Our
proposed universal successor features approximators (USFAs) combine the
advantages of all of these, namely the scalability of UVFAs, the instant
inference of SFs, and the strong generalisation of GPI. We discuss the
challenges involved in training a USFA, its generalisation properties and

generative modelling. In this paper we describe three natural properties of
probability divergences that reflect requirements from machine learning: sum
invariance, scale sensitivity, and unbiased sample gradients. The Wasserstein
metric possesses the first two properties but, unlike the Kullback-Leibler
divergence, does not possess the third. We provide empirical evidence
suggesting that this is a serious issue in practice. Leveraging insights from
probabilistic forecasting we propose an alternative to the Wasserstein metric,
the Cram\'er distance. We show that the Cram\'er distance possesses all three
desired properties, combining the best of the Wasserstein and Kullback-Leibler
divergences. To illustrate the relevance of the Cram\'er distance in practice
we design a new algorithm, the Cram\'er Generative Adversarial Network (GAN),

Our method can leverage continuous skill spaces, theoretically, allowing us to
learn infinitely many behaviors even for high-dimensional state-spaces. We

Abstract      = {In the context of learning deterministic policies in continuous domains, we
revisit an approach, which was first proposed in Continuous Actor Critic
Learning Automaton (CACLA) and later extended in Neural Fitted Actor Critic
(NFAC). This approach is based on a policy update different from that of
deterministic policy gradient (DPG). Previous work has observed its excellent
performance empirically, but a theoretical justification is lacking. To fill
this gap, we provide a theoretical explanation to motivate this unorthodox
policy update by relating it to another update and making explicit the
objective function of the latter. We furthermore discuss in depth the
properties of these updates to get a deeper understanding of the overall
approach. In addition, we extend it and propose a new trust region algorithm,
Penalized NFAC (PeNFAC). Finally, we experimentally demonstrate in several
classic control problems that it surpasses the state-of-the-art algorithms to
learn deterministic policies.},

Abstract      = {We present Residual Policy Learning (RPL): a simple method for improving
nondifferentiable policies using model-free deep reinforcement learning. RPL
thrives in complex robotic manipulation tasks where good but imperfect
controllers are available. In these tasks, reinforcement learning from scratch
remains data-inefficient or intractable, but learning a residual on top of the
initial controller can yield substantial improvements. We study RPL in six
challenging MuJoCo tasks involving partial observability, sensor noise, model
misspecification, and controller miscalibration. For initial controllers, we
consider both hand-designed policies and model-predictive controllers with
known or learned transition models. By combining learning with control
algorithms, RPL can perform long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks for which
reinforcement learning alone fails. Moreover, we find that RPL consistently and
substantially improves on the initial controllers. We argue that RPL is a
promising approach for combining the complementary strengths of deep
reinforcement learning and robotic control, pushing the boundaries of what
either can achieve independently. Video and code at

the exact gradient, policy optimization is difficult due to the geometry of the
objective function. Then, we qualitatively show that in some environments, a
policy with higher entropy can make the optimization landscape smoother,
thereby connecting local optima and enabling the use of larger learning rates.
This paper presents new tools for understanding the optimization landscape,
shows that policy entropy serves as a regularizer, and highlights the challenge

Abstract      = {A long-term goal of AI is to produce agents that can learn a diversity of
skills throughout their lifetimes and continuously improve those skills via
experience. A longstanding obstacle towards that goal is catastrophic
forgetting, which is when learning new information erases previously learned
information. Catastrophic forgetting occurs in artificial neural networks
(ANNs), which have fueled most recent advances in AI. A recent paper proposed
that catastrophic forgetting in ANNs can be reduced by promoting modularity,
which can limit forgetting by isolating task information to specific clusters
of nodes and connections (functional modules). While the prior work did show
that modular ANNs suffered less from catastrophic forgetting, it was not able
to produce ANNs that possessed task-specific functional modules, thereby
leaving the main theory regarding modularity and forgetting untested. We
introduce diffusion-based neuromodulation, which simulates the release of
diffusing, neuromodulatory chemicals within an ANN that can modulate (i.e. up
or down regulate) learning in a spatial region. On the simple diagnostic
problem from the prior work, diffusion-based neuromodulation 1) induces
task-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections (task-specific
localized learning), which 2) produces functional modules for each subtask, and
3) yields higher performance by eliminating catastrophic forgetting. Overall,
our results suggest that diffusion-based neuromodulation promotes task-specific
localized learning and functional modularity, which can help solve the
challenging, but important problem of catastrophic forgetting.},

PPG is able to achieve the best of both worlds by splitting optimization into
two phases, one that advances training and one that distills features. PPG also

Abstract      = {We present a canonical way to turn any smooth parametric family of

continuous-time black-box optimization method on $X$, the
\emph{information-geometric optimization} (IGO) method. Invariance as a design
principle minimizes the number of arbitrary choices. The resulting \emph{IGO
flow} conducts the natural gradient ascent of an adaptive, time-dependent,
quantile-based transformation of the objective function. It makes no
assumptions on the objective function to be optimized.
  The IGO method produces explicit IGO algorithms through time discretization.
It naturally recovers versions of known algorithms and offers a systematic way
to derive new ones. The cross-entropy method is recovered in a particular case,
and can be extended into a smoothed, parametrization-independent maximum
likelihood update (IGO-ML). For Gaussian distributions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, IGO
is related to natural evolution strategies (NES) and recovers a version of the
CMA-ES algorithm. For Bernoulli distributions on $\{0,1\}^d$, we recover the
PBIL algorithm. From restricted Boltzmann machines, we obtain a novel algorithm
for optimization on $\{0,1\}^d$. All these algorithms are unified under a
single information-geometric optimization framework.
  Thanks to its intrinsic formulation, the IGO method achieves invariance under
reparametrization of the search space $X$, under a change of parameters of the
probability distributions, and under increasing transformations of the
objective function.
  Theory strongly suggests that IGO algorithms have minimal loss in diversity
during optimization, provided the initial diversity is high. First experiments
using restricted Boltzmann machines confirm this insight. Thus IGO seems to
provide, from information theory, an elegant way to spontaneously explore
several valleys of a fitness landscape in a single run.},

control has a long history, the study of safe RL algorithms is still in the
early stages. To establish a good foundation for future research in this
thread, in this paper, we provide a review for safe RL from the perspectives of
methods, theory and applications. Firstly, we review the progress of safe RL
from five dimensions and come up with five problems that are crucial for safe
RL being deployed in real-world applications, coined as "2H3W". Secondly, we
analyze the theory and algorithm progress from the perspectives of answering
the "2H3W" problems. Then, the sample complexity of safe RL methods is reviewed
and discussed, followed by an introduction of the applications and benchmarks
of safe RL algorithms. Finally, we open the discussion of the challenging

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample

the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we
describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy
actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this
framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and
entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible.
We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training
and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a
constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature
hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks,
as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal
robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements,
SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and
off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms,
our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different
random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for
learning in real-world robotics tasks.},

model-generated on-policy data, but we show that an empirical estimate of model
generalization can be incorporated into such analysis to justify model usage.
Motivated by this analysis, we then demonstrate that a simple procedure of
using short model-generated rollouts branched from real data has the benefits
of more complicated model-based algorithms without the usual pitfalls. In
particular, this approach surpasses the sample efficiency of prior model-based
methods, matches the asymptotic performance of the best model-free algorithms,
and scales to horizons that cause other model-based methods to fail entirely.},

Abstract      = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone a renaissance recently, making
major progress in key domains such as vision, language, control, and
decision-making. This has been due, in part, to cheap data and cheap compute
resources, which have fit the natural strengths of deep learning. However, many
defining characteristics of human intelligence, which developed under much
different pressures, remain out of reach for current approaches. In particular,
generalizing beyond one's experiences--a hallmark of human intelligence from
infancy--remains a formidable challenge for modern AI.
  The following is part position paper, part review, and part unification. We
argue that combinatorial generalization must be a top priority for AI to
achieve human-like abilities, and that structured representations and
computations are key to realizing this objective. Just as biology uses nature
and nurture cooperatively, we reject the false choice between
"hand-engineering" and "end-to-end" learning, and instead advocate for an
approach which benefits from their complementary strengths. We explore how
using relational inductive biases within deep learning architectures can
facilitate learning about entities, relations, and rules for composing them. We
present a new building block for the AI toolkit with a strong relational
inductive bias--the graph network--which generalizes and extends various
approaches for neural networks that operate on graphs, and provides a
straightforward interface for manipulating structured knowledge and producing
structured behaviors. We discuss how graph networks can support relational
reasoning and combinatorial generalization, laying the foundation for more
sophisticated, interpretable, and flexible patterns of reasoning. As a
companion to this paper, we have released an open-source software library for
building graph networks, with demonstrations of how to use them in practice.},

distribution between the expert and the agent could be unstable during
training. We propose a new framework for imitation learning by estimating the
support of the expert policy to compute a fixed reward function, which allows
us to re-frame imitation learning within the standard reinforcement learning

governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or
the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM). We perform inference in the model by
approximate variational marginalization. This results in a strict lower bound
on the marginal likelihood of the model which we use for model selection
(number of layers and nodes per layer). Deep belief networks are typically
applied to relatively large data sets using stochastic gradient descent for
optimization. Our fully Bayesian treatment allows for the application of deep
models even when data is scarce. Model selection by our variational bound shows
that a five layer hierarchy is justified even when modelling a digit data set
containing only 150 examples.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious
phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor
filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to
a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many
datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to
specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been
studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality
versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural
network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively
affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons
to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which
was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks
between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network
trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may
dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,
middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of
features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task
increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better
than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a
network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce
a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target
dataset.},

Abstract      = {Transfer in Reinforcement Learning aims to improve learning performance on

Representations (SR) and their extension Successor Features (SF) are prominent
transfer mechanisms in domains where reward functions change between tasks.
They reevaluate the expected return of previously learned policies in a new
target task to transfer their knowledge. The SF framework extended SR by
linearly decomposing rewards into successor features and a reward weight vector
allowing their application in high-dimensional tasks. But this came with the
cost of having a linear relationship between reward functions and successor
features, limiting its application to such tasks. We propose a novel
formulation of SR based on learning the cumulative discounted probability of
successor features, called Successor Feature Representations (SFR). Crucially,
SFR allows to reevaluate the expected return of policies for general reward
functions. We introduce different SFR variations, prove its convergence, and
provide a guarantee on its transfer performance. Experimental evaluations based
on SFR with function approximation demonstrate its advantage over SF not only
for general reward functions but also in the case of linearly decomposable

Abstract      = {Learning locomotion skills is a challenging problem. To generate realistic
and smooth locomotion, existing methods use motion capture, finite state
machines or morphology-specific knowledge to guide the motion generation
algorithms. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a promising approach for the
automatic creation of locomotion control. Indeed, a standard benchmark for DRL
is to automatically create a running controller for a biped character from a
simple reward function. Although several different DRL algorithms can
successfully create a running controller, the resulting motions usually look
nothing like a real runner. This paper takes a minimalist learning approach to
the locomotion problem, without the use of motion examples, finite state
machines, or morphology-specific knowledge. We introduce two modifications to
the DRL approach that, when used together, produce locomotion behaviors that
are symmetric, low-energy, and much closer to that of a real person. First, we
introduce a new term to the loss function (not the reward function) that
encourages symmetric actions. Second, we introduce a new curriculum learning
method that provides modulated physical assistance to help the character with
left/right balance and forward movement. The algorithm automatically computes
appropriate assistance to the character and gradually relaxes this assistance,
so that eventually the character learns to move entirely without help. Because
our method does not make use of motion capture data, it can be applied to a
variety of character morphologies. We demonstrate locomotion controllers for
the lower half of a biped, a full humanoid, a quadruped, and a hexapod. Our
results show that learned policies are able to produce symmetric, low-energy
gaits. In addition, speed-appropriate gait patterns emerge without any guidance
from motion examples or contact planning.},

Abstract      = {Legged robots often use separate control policiesthat are highly engineered
for traversing difficult terrain suchas stairs, gaps, and steps, where
switching between policies isonly possible when the robot is in a region that

promising alternative to hand-crafted control design,though typically requires
the full set of test conditions to beknown before training. DRL policies can
result in complex(often unrealistic) behaviours that have few or no
overlappingregions between adjacent policies, making it difficult to
switchbehaviours. In this work we develop multiple DRL policieswith Curriculum
Learning (CL), each that can traverse asingle respective terrain condition,
while ensuring an overlapbetween policies. We then train a network for each
destinationpolicy that estimates the likelihood of successfully switchingfrom
any other policy. We evaluate our switching methodon a previously unseen
combination of terrain artifacts andshow that it performs better than heuristic
methods. Whileour method is trained on individual terrain types, it
performscomparably to a Deep Q Network trained on the full set ofterrain
conditions. This approach allows the development ofseparate policies in
constrained conditions with embedded priorknowledge about each behaviour, that

in latent space, the decisions are interpretable because the world model can
decode goals into images for visualization. Director outperforms exploration
methods on tasks with sparse rewards, including 3D maze traversal with a

most common method for generating exploratory actions involves sampling from a
Gaussian distribution centred around the mean action output by a policy.
Although these methods can be quite capable, they do not scale well with the
dimensionality of the action space, and can be dangerous to apply on hardware.
We consider learning a forward dynamics model to predict the result,
($x_{t+1}$), of taking a particular action, ($u$), given a specific observation
of the state, ($x_{t}$). With this model we perform internal look-ahead
predictions of outcomes and seek actions we believe have a reasonable chance of

Abstract      = {The aim in imitation learning is to learn effective policies by utilizing
near-optimal expert demonstrations. However, high-quality demonstrations from
human experts can be expensive to obtain in large numbers. On the other hand,
it is often much easier to obtain large quantities of suboptimal or
task-agnostic trajectories, which are not useful for direct imitation, but can
nevertheless provide insight into the dynamical structure of the environment,
showing what could be done in the environment even if not what should be done.
We ask the question, is it possible to utilize such suboptimal offline datasets
to facilitate provably improved downstream imitation learning? In this work, we
answer this question affirmatively and present training objectives that use
offline datasets to learn a factored transition model whose structure enables
the extraction of a latent action space. Our theoretical analysis shows that
the learned latent action space can boost the sample-efficiency of downstream
imitation learning, effectively reducing the need for large near-optimal expert
datasets through the use of auxiliary non-expert data. To learn the latent
action space in practice, we propose TRAIL (Transition-Reparametrized Actions
for Imitation Learning), an algorithm that learns an energy-based transition
model contrastively, and uses the transition model to reparametrize the action
space for sample-efficient imitation learning. We evaluate the practicality of
our objective through experiments on a set of navigation and locomotion tasks.
Our results verify the benefits suggested by our theory and show that TRAIL is
able to improve baseline imitation learning by up to 4x in performance.},

such successes have been limited to deterministic fully-observed environments.
We present a new approach that handles stochastic and partially-observable
environments. Our key insight is to use discrete autoencoders to capture the
multiple possible effects of an action in a stochastic environment. We use a
stochastic variant of Monte Carlo tree search to plan over both the agent's
actions and the discrete latent variables representing the environment's
response. Our approach significantly outperforms an offline version of MuZero
on a stochastic interpretation of chess where the opponent is considered part
of the environment. We also show that our approach scales to DeepMind Lab, a
first-person 3D environment with large visual observations and partial
observability.},

student model for pose estimation on real data. To continuously improve the
quality of pseudo labels, we iterate the above steps by taking the trained
student model as a new teacher and re-label real data using the refined teacher
model. We evaluate our method on a public benchmark and our newly-released

Abstract      = {Skill chaining is a promising approach for synthesizing complex behaviors by
sequentially combining previously learned skills. Yet, a naive composition of
skills fails when a policy encounters a starting state never seen during its

policy's starting state distribution. However, these approaches require larger
state distributions to be covered as more policies are sequenced, and thus are
limited to short skill sequences. In this paper, we propose to chain multiple
policies without excessively large initial state distributions by regularizing
the terminal state distributions in an adversarial learning framework. We
evaluate our approach on two complex long-horizon manipulation tasks of
furniture assembly. Our results have shown that our method establishes the
first model-free reinforcement learning algorithm to solve these tasks; whereas

optimization process from being misled by the possible false minima introduced
by the surrogate. To address this issue, we present two strategies for SC to
control the workflow of hybrid frameworks. Experiments on six continuous

significantly reduce the cost of fitness evaluations, but also boost the
performance of the original hybrid frameworks with collaborative learning and

Abstract      = {It has long been assumed that high dimensional continuous control problems
cannot be solved effectively by discretizing individual dimensions of the
action space due to the exponentially large number of bins over which policies
would have to be learned. In this paper, we draw inspiration from the recent
success of sequence-to-sequence models for structured prediction problems to
develop policies over discretized spaces. Central to this method is the
realization that complex functions over high dimensional spaces can be modeled
by neural networks that predict one dimension at a time. Specifically, we show
how Q-values and policies over continuous spaces can be modeled using a next
step prediction model over discretized dimensions. With this parameterization,
it is possible to both leverage the compositional structure of action spaces
during learning, as well as compute maxima over action spaces (approximately).
On a simple example task we demonstrate empirically that our method can perform
global search, which effectively gets around the local optimization issues that
plague DDPG. We apply the technique to off-policy (Q-learning) methods and show
that our method can achieve the state-of-the-art for off-policy methods on
several continuous control tasks.},

simulator. By comparing the pose instructed by the kinematic model against the
pose generated by the dynamics model, we can use their misalignment to further
improve the kinematic model. By factoring in the 6DoF pose of objects (e.g.,

is that the information of the best policy is fused in a soft manner by
constructing an augmented loss function for policy update to enlarge the

best policy and the enlarged range enable faster and better policy search.
Monotone improvement of the expected cumulative return by the proposed scheme

Abstract      = {Solving a reinforcement learning (RL) problem poses two competing challenges:
fitting a potentially discontinuous value function, and generalizing well to
new observations. In this paper, we analyze the learning dynamics of temporal
difference algorithms to gain novel insight into the tension between these two
objectives. We show theoretically that temporal difference learning encourages
agents to fit non-smooth components of the value function early in training,
and at the same time induces the second-order effect of discouraging
generalization. We corroborate these findings in deep RL agents trained on a
range of environments, finding that neural networks trained using temporal
difference algorithms on dense reward tasks exhibit weaker generalization
between states than randomly initialized networks and networks trained with
policy gradient methods. Finally, we investigate how post-training policy
distillation may avoid this pitfall, and show that this approach improves
generalization to novel environments in the ProcGen suite and improves
robustness to input perturbations.},

Abstract      = {A new framework for formulating reachability problems with competing inputs,

developed. Such reach-avoid problems arise in, among others, the study of
safety problems in hybrid systems. Earlier approaches to reach-avoid
computations are either restricted to linear systems, or face numerical
difficulties due to possible discontinuities in the Hamiltonian of the optimal
control problem. The main advantage of the approach proposed in this paper is
that it can be applied to a general class of target hitting continuous dynamic
games with nonlinear dynamics, and has very good properties in terms of its
numerical solution, since the value function and the Hamiltonian of the system
are both continuous. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by
applying it to a two aircraft collision avoidance scenario under target window
constraints and in the presence of wind disturbance. Target Windows are a novel
concept in air traffic management, and represent spatial and temporal
constraints, that the aircraft have to respect to meet their schedule.},

algorithms, showing how they are extended to the deep context and effective
mechanisms that could be added on top of the DRL algorithms. We then introduce
representative works that utilize DRL to solve navigation and manipulation
tasks in robotics. We continue our discussion on methods addressing the
challenge of the reality gap for transferring DRL policies trained in
simulation to real-world scenarios, and summarize robotics simulation platforms
for conducting DRL research. For imitation leaning, we go through its three
main categories, behavior cloning, inverse reinforcement learning and
generative adversarial imitation learning, by introducing their formulations
and their corresponding robotics applications. Finally, we discuss the open

We propose a new notion of action value defined by a Gaussian smoothed version
of the expected Q-value. We show that such smoothed Q-values still satisfy a
Bellman equation, making them learnable from experience sampled from an
environment. Moreover, the gradients of expected reward with respect to the
mean and covariance of a parameterized Gaussian policy can be recovered from
the gradient and Hessian of the smoothed Q-value function. Based on these
relationships, we develop new algorithms for training a Gaussian policy
directly from a learned smoothed Q-value approximator. The approach is
additionally amenable to proximal optimization by augmenting the objective with
a penalty on KL-divergence from a previous policy. We find that the ability to
learn both a mean and covariance during training leads to significantly
improved results on standard continuous control benchmarks.},

The algorithm is the result of observing that the optimal policy and state
values of a maximum reward objective with a relative-entropy regularizer
satisfy a set of multi-step pathwise consistencies along any path. Thus,
Trust-PCL is able to maintain optimization stability while exploiting
off-policy data to improve sample efficiency. When evaluated on a number of

Abstract      = {In this work we create agents that can perform well beyond a single,
individual task, that exhibit much wider generalisation of behaviour to a
massive, rich space of challenges. We define a universe of tasks within an
environment domain and demonstrate the ability to train agents that are
generally capable across this vast space and beyond. The environment is
natively multi-agent, spanning the continuum of competitive, cooperative, and
independent games, which are situated within procedurally generated physical 3D
worlds. The resulting space is exceptionally diverse in terms of the challenges
posed to agents, and as such, even measuring the learning progress of an agent
is an open research problem. We propose an iterative notion of improvement
between successive generations of agents, rather than seeking to maximise a
singular objective, allowing us to quantify progress despite tasks being
incomparable in terms of achievable rewards. We show that through constructing
an open-ended learning process, which dynamically changes the training task
distributions and training objectives such that the agent never stops learning,
we achieve consistent learning of new behaviours. The resulting agent is able
to score reward in every one of our humanly solvable evaluation levels, with
behaviour generalising to many held-out points in the universe of tasks.
Examples of this zero-shot generalisation include good performance on Hide and
Seek, Capture the Flag, and Tag. Through analysis and hand-authored probe tasks
we characterise the behaviour of our agent, and find interesting emergent
heuristic behaviours such as trial-and-error experimentation, simple tool use,
option switching, and cooperation. Finally, we demonstrate that the general
capabilities of this agent could unlock larger scale transfer of behaviour

Abstract      = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) have recently been achieving state-of-the-art
performance on a variety of pattern-recognition tasks, most notably visual
classification problems. Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in
images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what
differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed
that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can
cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a
lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images
that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs
believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99% confidence (e.g. labeling with
certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take
convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or
MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient
ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class.
It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs
believe with near certainty are familiar objects, which we call "fooling
images" (more generally, fooling examples). Our results shed light on
interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise
questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},

Abstract      = {Intelligent behaviour in the physical world exhibits structure at multiple
spatial and temporal scales. Although movements are ultimately executed at the
level of instantaneous muscle tensions or joint torques, they must be selected
to serve goals defined on much longer timescales, and in terms of relations
that extend far beyond the body itself, ultimately involving coordination with
other agents. Recent research in artificial intelligence has shown the promise
of learning-based approaches to the respective problems of complex movement,
longer-term planning and multi-agent coordination. However, there is limited
research aimed at their integration. We study this problem by training teams of
physically simulated humanoid avatars to play football in a realistic virtual
environment. We develop a method that combines imitation learning, single- and
multi-agent reinforcement learning and population-based training, and makes use
of transferable representations of behaviour for decision making at different
levels of abstraction. In a sequence of stages, players first learn to control
a fully articulated body to perform realistic, human-like movements such as
running and turning; they then acquire mid-level football skills such as
dribbling and shooting; finally, they develop awareness of others and play as a
team, bridging the gap between low-level motor control at a timescale of
milliseconds, and coordinated goal-directed behaviour as a team at the
timescale of tens of seconds. We investigate the emergence of behaviours at
different levels of abstraction, as well as the representations that underlie
these behaviours using several analysis techniques, including statistics from
real-world sports analytics. Our work constitutes a complete demonstration of

Abstract      = {Evolution strategies (ES) are a family of black-box optimization algorithms
able to train deep neural networks roughly as well as Q-learning and policy
gradient methods on challenging deep reinforcement learning (RL) problems, but
are much faster (e.g. hours vs. days) because they parallelize better. However,
many RL problems require directed exploration because they have reward
functions that are sparse or deceptive (i.e. contain local optima), and it is
unknown how to encourage such exploration with ES. Here we show that algorithms
that have been invented to promote directed exploration in small-scale evolved
neural networks via populations of exploring agents, specifically novelty
search (NS) and quality diversity (QD) algorithms, can be hybridized with ES to
improve its performance on sparse or deceptive deep RL tasks, while retaining
scalability. Our experiments confirm that the resultant new algorithms, NS-ES
and two QD algorithms, NSR-ES and NSRA-ES, avoid local optima encountered by ES
to achieve higher performance on Atari and simulated robots learning to walk
around a deceptive trap. This paper thus introduces a family of fast, scalable
algorithms for reinforcement learning that are capable of directed exploration.
It also adds this new family of exploration algorithms to the RL toolbox and
raises the interesting possibility that analogous algorithms with multiple
simultaneous paths of exploration might also combine well with existing RL
algorithms outside ES.},

to operate in multiple perceptually diverse environments with distinct
affordances. By learning to compose lower-level programs to express
higher-level programs, NPI reduces sample complexity and increases
generalization ability compared to sequence-to-sequence LSTMs. The program
memory allows efficient learning of additional tasks by building on existing
programs. NPI can also harness the environment (e.g. a scratch pad with
read-write pointers) to cache intermediate results of computation, lessening
the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train
the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example
sequences of calls to the immediate subprograms conditioned on the input.
Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns
from a small number of rich examples. We demonstrate the capability of our

extensive experimental evaluation, by comparing with classical weight decay and
Lasso penalties. We show that a sparse version of the group Lasso penalty is
able to achieve competitive performances, while at the same time resulting in
extremely compact networks with a smaller number of input features. We evaluate

nonstationarity of the incoming data. We address the first challenge by using
value functions to substantially reduce the variance of policy gradient
estimates at the cost of some bias, with an exponentially-weighted estimator of
the advantage function that is analogous to TD(lambda). We address the second
challenge by using trust region optimization procedure for both the policy and
the value function, which are represented by neural networks.
  Our approach yields strong empirical results on highly challenging 3D
locomotion tasks, learning running gaits for bipedal and quadrupedal simulated
robots, and learning a policy for getting the biped to stand up from starting
out lying on the ground. In contrast to a body of prior work that uses
hand-crafted policy representations, our neural network policies map directly
from raw kinematics to joint torques. Our algorithm is fully model-free, and
the amount of simulated experience required for the learning tasks on 3D bipeds
corresponds to 1-2 weeks of real time.},

Abstract      = {Robotic tasks often require motions with complex geometric structures. We
present an approach to learn such motions from a limited number of human
demonstrations by exploiting the regularity properties of human motions e.g.
stability, smoothness, and boundedness. The complex motions are encoded as
rollouts of a stable dynamical system, which, under a change of coordinates
defined by a diffeomorphism, is equivalent to a simple, hand-specified
dynamical system. As an immediate result of using diffeomorphisms, the
stability property of the hand-specified dynamical system directly carry over
to the learned dynamical system. Inspired by recent works in density
estimation, we propose to represent the diffeomorphism as a composition of
simple parameterized diffeomorphisms. Additional structure is imposed to
provide guarantees on the smoothness of the generated motions. The efficacy of
this approach is demonstrated through validation on an established benchmark as
well demonstrations collected on a real-world robotic system.},

Abstract      = {Acquiring a diverse repertoire of general-purpose skills remains an open
challenge for robotics. In this work, we propose self-supervising control on
top of human teleoperated play data as a way to scale up skill learning. Play
has two properties that make it attractive compared to conventional task
demonstrations. Play is cheap, as it can be collected in large quantities
quickly without task segmenting, labeling, or resetting to an initial state.
Play is naturally rich, covering ~4x more interaction space than task
demonstrations for the same amount of collection time. To learn control from
play, we introduce Play-LMP, a self-supervised method that learns to organize
play behaviors in a latent space, then reuse them at test time to achieve
specific goals. Combining self-supervised control with a diverse play dataset
shifts the focus of skill learning from a narrow and discrete set of tasks to
the full continuum of behaviors available in an environment. We find that this
combination generalizes well empirically---after self-supervising on unlabeled
play, our method substantially outperforms individual expert-trained policies
on 18 difficult user-specified visual manipulation tasks in a simulated robotic
tabletop environment. We additionally find that play-supervised models, unlike
their expert-trained counterparts, are more robust to perturbations and exhibit
retrying-till-success behaviors. Finally, we find that our agent organizes its
latent plan space around functional tasks, despite never being trained with
task labels. Videos, code and data are available at

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {How quickly can a given class of concepts be learned from examples? It is
common to measure the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm by
plotting its "learning curve", that is, the decay of the error rate as a
function of the number of training examples. However, the classical theoretical
framework for understanding learnability, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis
and Valiant, does not explain the behavior of learning curves: the
distribution-free PAC model of learning can only bound the upper envelope of
the learning curves over all possible data distributions. This does not match
the practice of machine learning, where the data source is typically fixed in
any given scenario, while the learner may choose the number of training
examples on the basis of factors such as computational resources and desired
accuracy.
  In this paper, we study an alternative learning model that better captures
such practical aspects of machine learning, but still gives rise to a complete
theory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely, we
consider the problem of universal learning, which aims to understand the
performance of learning algorithms on every data distribution, but without
requiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this paper is a
remarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of universal
learning. More precisely, we show that the learning curves of any given concept
class decay either at an exponential, linear, or arbitrarily slow rates.
Moreover, each of these cases is completely characterized by appropriate
combinatorial parameters, and we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that
achieve the best possible rate in each case.
  For concreteness, we consider in this paper only the realizable case, though
analogous results are expected to extend to more general learning scenarios.},

Abstract      = {Enabling artificial agents to automatically learn complex, versatile and
high-performing behaviors is a long-lasting challenge. This paper presents a
step in this direction with hierarchical behavioral repertoires that stack
several behavioral repertoires to generate sophisticated behaviors. Each
repertoire of this architecture uses the lower repertoires to create complex
behaviors as sequences of simpler ones, while only the lowest repertoire
directly controls the agent's movements. This paper also introduces a novel
approach to automatically define behavioral descriptors thanks to an
unsupervised neural network that organizes the produced high-level behaviors.
The experiments show that the proposed architecture enables a robot to learn
how to draw digits in an unsupervised manner after having learned to draw lines
and arcs. Compared to traditional behavioral repertoires, the proposed
architecture reduces the dimensionality of the optimization problems by orders
of magnitude and provides behaviors with a twice better fitness. More
importantly, it enables the transfer of knowledge between robots: a
hierarchical repertoire evolved for a robotic arm to draw digits can be
transferred to a humanoid robot by simply changing the lowest layer of the
hierarchy. This enables the humanoid to draw digits although it has never been
trained for this task.},

Abstract      = {Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) can solve tasks in a wide range

distant goals remains a central challenge to the field. Learning to reach such
goals is particularly hard without any offline data, expert demonstrations, and
reward shaping. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to solve the distant
goal-reaching task by using search at training time to automatically generate a
curriculum of intermediate states. Our algorithm, Classifier-Planning
(C-Planning), frames the learning of the goal-conditioned policies as
expectation maximization: the E-step corresponds to planning an optimal
sequence of waypoints using graph search, while the M-step aims to learn a
goal-conditioned policy to reach those waypoints. Unlike prior methods that
combine goal-conditioned RL with graph search, ours performs search only during
training and not testing, significantly decreasing the compute costs of
deploying the learned policy. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method is
more sample efficient than prior methods. Moreover, it is able to solve very
long horizons manipulation and navigation tasks, tasks that prior
goal-conditioned methods and methods based on graph search fail to solve.},

with large output spaces, it has been empirically observed that these
algorithms fail to converge to an optimal solution (or a critical point in
nonconvex settings). We show that one cause for such failures is the
exponential moving average used in the algorithms. We provide an explicit
example of a simple convex optimization setting where Adam does not converge to
the optimal solution, and describe the precise problems with the previous
analysis of Adam algorithm. Our analysis suggests that the convergence issues
can be fixed by endowing such algorithms with `long-term memory' of past

  Reinforcement Learning},

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {In the trial-and-error mechanism of reinforcement learning (RL), a notorious
contradiction arises when we expect to learn a safe policy: how to learn a safe
policy without enough data and prior model about the dangerous region? Existing
methods mostly use the posterior penalty for dangerous actions, which means
that the agent is not penalized until experiencing danger. This fact causes
that the agent cannot learn a zero-violation policy even after convergence.
Otherwise, it would not receive any penalty and lose the knowledge about
danger. In this paper, we propose the safe set actor-critic (SSAC) algorithm,
which confines the policy update using safety-oriented energy functions, or the
safety indexes. The safety index is designed to increase rapidly for
potentially dangerous actions, which allows us to locate the safe set on the
action space, or the control safe set. Therefore, we can identify the dangerous
actions prior to taking them, and further obtain a zero constraint-violation
policy after convergence.We claim that we can learn the energy function in a
model-free manner similar to learning a value function. By using the energy
function transition as the constraint objective, we formulate a constrained RL
problem. We prove that our Lagrangian-based solutions make sure that the
learned policy will converge to the constrained optimum under some assumptions.
The proposed algorithm is evaluated on both the complex simulation environments
and a hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiment with a real controller from the
autonomous vehicle. Experimental results suggest that the converged policy in
all environments achieves zero constraint violation and comparable performance
with model-based baselines.},

Our key idea is to build a tree of local control policies represented by neural

policy that attempts to achieve the task from a small set of initial states,
each subsequent policy expands the set of successful initial states by driving
the new states to existing "good" states. Our algorithm utilizes the value
function of the policy to determine whether a state is "good" under each
policy. We take advantage of many existing policy search algorithms that learn
the value function simultaneously with the policy, such as those that use
actor-critic representations or those that use the advantage function to reduce

Eprint        = {1905.11108v3},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Learning to imitate expert behavior from demonstrations can be challenging,
especially in environments with high-dimensional, continuous observations and
unknown dynamics. Supervised learning methods based on behavioral cloning (BC)
suffer from distribution shift: because the agent greedily imitates
demonstrated actions, it can drift away from demonstrated states due to error
accumulation. Recent methods based on reinforcement learning (RL), such as
inverse RL and generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), overcome this
issue by training an RL agent to match the demonstrations over a long horizon.
Since the true reward function for the task is unknown, these methods learn a
reward function from the demonstrations, often using complex and brittle
approximation techniques that involve adversarial training. We propose a simple
alternative that still uses RL, but does not require learning a reward
function. The key idea is to provide the agent with an incentive to match the
demonstrations over a long horizon, by encouraging it to return to demonstrated
states upon encountering new, out-of-distribution states. We accomplish this by
giving the agent a constant reward of r=+1 for matching the demonstrated action
in a demonstrated state, and a constant reward of r=0 for all other behavior.
Our method, which we call soft Q imitation learning (SQIL), can be implemented
with a handful of minor modifications to any standard Q-learning or off-policy
actor-critic algorithm. Theoretically, we show that SQIL can be interpreted as
a regularized variant of BC that uses a sparsity prior to encourage
long-horizon imitation. Empirically, we show that SQIL outperforms BC and
achieves competitive results compared to GAIL, on a variety of image-based and
low-dimensional tasks in Box2D, Atari, and MuJoCo.},

Abstract      = {We present a new approach for efficient exploration which leverages a
low-dimensional encoding of the environment learned with a combination of
model-based and model-free objectives. Our approach uses intrinsic rewards that
are based on the distance of nearest neighbors in the low dimensional
representational space to gauge novelty. We then leverage these intrinsic
rewards for sample-efficient exploration with planning routines in
representational space for hard exploration tasks with sparse rewards. One key
element of our approach is the use of information theoretic principles to shape
our representations in a way so that our novelty reward goes beyond pixel
similarity. We test our approach on a number of maze tasks, as well as a
control problem and show that our exploration approach is more sample-efficient
compared to strong baselines.},

Abstract      = {In reinforcement learning an agent interacts with the environment by taking
actions and observing the next state and reward. When sampled
probabilistically, these state transitions, rewards, and actions can all induce
randomness in the observed long-term return. Traditionally, reinforcement
learning algorithms average over this randomness to estimate the value
function. In this paper, we build on recent work advocating a distributional
approach to reinforcement learning in which the distribution over returns is
modeled explicitly instead of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine
methods of learning the value distribution instead of the value function. We
give results that close a number of gaps between the theoretical and
algorithmic results given by Bellemare, Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we
extend existing results to the approximate distribution setting. Second, we
present a novel distributional reinforcement learning algorithm consistent with
our theoretical formulation. Finally, we evaluate this new algorithm on the
Atari 2600 games, observing that it significantly outperforms many of the
recent improvements on DQN, including the related distributional algorithm C51.},

Abstract      = {Learning meaningful behaviors in the absence of reward is a difficult problem

is to learn a set of diverse skills that provide a thorough coverage of the

the environment. In this paper, we build on the mutual information framework
for skill discovery and introduce UPSIDE, which addresses the
coverage-directedness trade-off in the following ways: 1) We design policies
with a decoupled structure of a directed skill, trained to reach a specific
region, followed by a diffusing part that induces a local coverage. 2) We
optimize policies by maximizing their number under the constraint that each of
them reaches distinct regions of the environment (i.e., they are sufficiently
discriminable) and prove that this serves as a lower bound to the original
mutual information objective. 3) Finally, we compose the learned directed
skills into a growing tree that adaptively covers the environment. We
illustrate in several navigation and control environments how the skills
learned by UPSIDE solve sparse-reward downstream tasks better than existing
baselines.},

Abstract      = {Exploration is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Many
of the current exploration methods for deep RL use task-agnostic objectives,
such as information gain or bonuses based on state visitation. However, many
practical applications of RL involve learning more than a single task, and
prior tasks can be used to inform how exploration should be performed in new
tasks. In this work, we explore how prior tasks can inform an agent about how
to explore effectively in new situations. We introduce a novel gradient-based
fast adaptation algorithm -- model agnostic exploration with structured noise
(MAESN) -- to learn exploration strategies from prior experience. The prior
experience is used both to initialize a policy and to acquire a latent
exploration space that can inject structured stochasticity into a policy,
producing exploration strategies that are informed by prior knowledge and are
more effective than random action-space noise. We show that MAESN is more
effective at learning exploration strategies when compared to prior meta-RL
methods, RL without learned exploration strategies, and task-agnostic
exploration methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated tasks:
locomotion with a wheeled robot, locomotion with a quadrupedal walker, and
object manipulation.},

To accelerate training, we introduce Reducible Holdout Loss Selection
(RHO-LOSS), a simple but principled technique which selects approximately those
points for training that most reduce the model's generalization loss. As a
result, RHO-LOSS mitigates the weaknesses of existing data selection methods:
techniques from the optimization literature typically select 'hard' (e.g. high
loss) points, but such points are often noisy (not learnable) or less
task-relevant. Conversely, curriculum learning prioritizes 'easy' points, but
such points need not be trained on once learned. In contrast, RHO-LOSS selects
points that are learnable, worth learning, and not yet learnt. RHO-LOSS trains
in far fewer steps than prior art, improves accuracy, and speeds up training on
a wide range of datasets, hyperparameters, and architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and
BERT). On the large web-scraped image dataset Clothing-1M, RHO-LOSS trains in
18x fewer steps and reaches 2% higher final accuracy than uniform data

motion imitation methods, a rich variety of novel strategies can naturally
emerge by exploring initial character states through a sample-efficient
Bayesian diversity search (BDS) algorithm. A second stage of optimization that
encourages novel policies can further enrich the unique strategies discovered.
Our method allows for the discovery of diverse and novel strategies for

Instead of searching for a single solution, Quality-Diversity algorithms are
searching for a large collection of both diverse and high-performing solutions.
The role of this collection is to cover the range of possible solution types as
much as possible, and to contain the best solution for each type. The
contribution of this paper is threefold. Firstly, we present a unifying
framework of Quality-Diversity optimization algorithms that covers the two main
algorithms of this family (Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites and
the Novelty Search with Local Competition), and that highlights the large
variety of variants that can be investigated within this family. Secondly, we
propose algorithms with a new selection mechanism for Quality-Diversity
algorithms that outperforms all the algorithms tested in this paper. Lastly, we
present a new collection management that overcomes the erosion issues observed
when using unstructured collections. These three contributions are supported by
extensive experimental comparisons of Quality-Diversity algorithms on three

features and re-sampling the noise periodically, which leads to a new
exploration method generalized state-dependent exploration (gSDE). We evaluate
gSDE both in simulation, on PyBullet continuous control tasks, and directly on
three different real robots: a tendon-driven elastic robot, a quadruped and an
RC car. The noise sampling interval of gSDE permits to have a compromise

Abstract      = {Hindsight goal relabeling has become a foundational technique in multi-goal
reinforcement learning (RL). The essential idea is that any trajectory can be
seen as a sub-optimal demonstration for reaching its final state. Intuitively,
learning from those arbitrary demonstrations can be seen as a form of imitation
learning (IL). However, the connection between hindsight goal relabeling and
imitation learning is not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework to understand hindsight goal relabeling from a divergence
minimization perspective. Recasting the goal reaching problem in the IL
framework not only allows us to derive several existing methods from first
principles, but also provides us with the tools from IL to improve goal
reaching algorithms. Experimentally, we find that under hindsight relabeling,
Q-learning outperforms behavioral cloning (BC). Yet, a vanilla combination of
both hurts performance. Concretely, we see that the BC loss only helps when
selectively applied to actions that get the agent closer to the goal according
to the Q-function. Our framework also explains the puzzling phenomenon wherein
a reward of (-1, 0) results in significantly better performance than a (0, 1)
reward for goal reaching.},

Abstract      = {Neural networks dominate the modern machine learning landscape, but their
training and success still suffer from sensitivity to empirical choices of
hyperparameters such as model architecture, loss function, and optimisation
algorithm. In this work we present \emph{Population Based Training (PBT)}, a
simple asynchronous optimisation algorithm which effectively utilises a fixed
computational budget to jointly optimise a population of models and their
hyperparameters to maximise performance. Importantly, PBT discovers a schedule
of hyperparameter settings rather than following the generally sub-optimal
strategy of trying to find a single fixed set to use for the whole course of
training. With just a small modification to a typical distributed
hyperparameter training framework, our method allows robust and reliable
training of models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PBT on deep
reinforcement learning problems, showing faster wall-clock convergence and
higher final performance of agents by optimising over a suite of
hyperparameters. In addition, we show the same method can be applied to
supervised learning for machine translation, where PBT is used to maximise the
BLEU score directly, and also to training of Generative Adversarial Networks to
maximise the Inception score of generated images. In all cases PBT results in
the automatic discovery of hyperparameter schedules and model selection which
results in stable training and better final performance.},

Abstract      = {Many real-world control problems involve both discrete decision variables -
such as the choice of control modes, gear switching or digital outputs - as
well as continuous decision variables - such as velocity setpoints, control
gains or analogue outputs. However, when defining the corresponding optimal
control or reinforcement learning problem, it is commonly approximated with
fully continuous or fully discrete action spaces. These simplifications aim at
tailoring the problem to a particular algorithm or solver which may only
support one type of action space. Alternatively, expert heuristics are used to
remove discrete actions from an otherwise continuous space. In contrast, we
propose to treat hybrid problems in their 'native' form by solving them with
hybrid reinforcement learning, which optimizes for discrete and continuous
actions simultaneously. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that the
proposed approach efficiently solves such natively hybrid reinforcement
learning problems. We then show, both in simulation and on robotic hardware,
the benefits of removing possibly imperfect expert-designed heuristics. Lastly,
hybrid reinforcement learning encourages us to rethink problem definitions. We
propose reformulating control problems, e.g. by adding meta actions, to improve
exploration or reduce mechanical wear and tear.},

Abstract      = {While reinforcement learning (RL) methods that learn an internal model of the

dimensional sensors can be challenging. Prior work has addressed this challenge
by learning low-dimensional representation of observations through auxiliary
objectives, such as reconstruction or value prediction. However, the alignment
between these auxiliary objectives and the RL objective is often unclear. In
this work, we propose a single objective which jointly optimizes a latent-space
model and policy to achieve high returns while remaining self-consistent. This
objective is a lower bound on expected returns. Unlike prior bounds for
model-based RL on policy exploration or model guarantees, our bound is directly
on the overall RL objective. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm
matches or improves the sample-efficiency of the best prior model-based and
model-free RL methods. While sample efficient methods typically are
computationally demanding, our method attains the performance of SAC in about
50% less wall-clock time.},

Abstract      = {Long-horizon planning in realistic environments requires the ability to
reason over sequential tasks in high-dimensional state spaces with complex
dynamics. Classical motion planning algorithms, such as rapidly-exploring
random trees, are capable of efficiently exploring large state spaces and
computing long-horizon, sequential plans. However, these algorithms are
generally challenged with complex, stochastic, and high-dimensional state
spaces as well as in the presence of narrow passages, which naturally emerge in
tasks that interact with the environment. Machine learning offers a promising
solution for its ability to learn general policies that can handle complex
interactions and high-dimensional observations. However, these policies are
generally limited in horizon length. Our approach, Broadly-Exploring,
Local-policy Trees (BELT), merges these two approaches to leverage the
strengths of both through a task-conditioned, model-based tree search. BELT
uses an RRT-inspired tree search to efficiently explore the state space.
Locally, the exploration is guided by a task-conditioned, learned policy
capable of performing general short-horizon tasks. This task space can be quite
general and abstract; its only requirements are to be sampleable and to
well-cover the space of useful tasks. This search is aided by a
task-conditioned model that temporally extends dynamics propagation to allow
long-horizon search and sequential reasoning over tasks. BELT is demonstrated
experimentally to be able to plan long-horizon, sequential trajectories with a
goal conditioned policy and generate plans that are robust.},

Abstract      = {We present a new algorithm for automatically bounding the Taylor remainder
series. In the special case of a scalar function $f: \mathbb{R} \to
\mathbb{R}$, our algorithm takes as input a reference point $x_0$, trust region
$[a, b]$, and integer $k \ge 1$, and returns an interval $I$ such that $f(x) -
\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} \frac {1} {i!} f^{(i)}(x_0) (x - x_0)^i \in I (x - x_0)^k$ for
all $x \in [a, b]$. As in automatic differentiation, the function $f$ is
provided to the algorithm in symbolic form, and must be composed of known
atomic functions.
  At a high level, our algorithm has two steps. First, for a variety of
commonly-used elementary functions (e.g., $\exp$, $\log$), we derive sharp
polynomial upper and lower bounds on the Taylor remainder series. We then
recursively combine the bounds for the elementary functions using an interval
arithmetic variant of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation. Our algorithm can
make efficient use of machine learning hardware accelerators, and we provide an
open source implementation in JAX.
  We then turn our attention to applications. Most notably, we use our new
machinery to create the first universal majorization-minimization optimization
algorithms: algorithms that iteratively minimize an arbitrary loss using a
majorizer that is derived automatically, rather than by hand. Applied to
machine learning, this leads to architecture-specific optimizers for training
deep networks that converge from any starting point, without hyperparameter
tuning. Our experiments show that for some optimization problems, these
hyperparameter-free optimizers outperform tuned versions of gradient descent,
Adam, and AdaGrad. We also show that our automatically-derived bounds can be
used for verified global optimization and numerical integration, and to prove
sharper versions of Jensen's inequality.},

approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow,
whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by
applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of
complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop
categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of
approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that
the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true
posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches,
provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational
inference.},

Abstract      = {The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools
and algorithms emerging from modern computing and data science.
First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions are giving way to
data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or
probabilistic frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant
perspective over the past decade, in which nonlinear dynamics are represented
in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator acting on the space of all
possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation of
nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction,
estimation, and control of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods
developed for linear systems. However, obtaining finite-dimensional coordinate
systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately linear
remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due
primarily to three key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it
to classical geometric approaches for dynamical systems, 2) the approach is
formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging big-data
and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical
algorithms, such as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed
and extended to reduce Koopman theory to practice in real-world applications.
In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman operator theory,
describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting
these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key
advances and challenges in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that
are likely to drive future developments and significantly transform the

Abstract      = {Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a key challenge in
reinforcement learning (RL). State-of-the-art RL algorithms suffer from high
sample complexity, particularly in the sparse reward case, where they can do no
better than to explore in all directions until the first positive rewards are
found. To mitigate this, we propose Rapidly Randomly-exploring Reinforcement
Learning (R3L). We formulate exploration as a search problem and leverage
widely-used planning algorithms such as Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) to
find initial solutions. These solutions are used as demonstrations to
initialize a policy, then refined by a generic RL algorithm, leading to faster
and more stable convergence. We provide theoretical guarantees of R3L
exploration finding successful solutions, as well as bounds for its sampling
complexity. We experimentally demonstrate the method outperforms classic and
intrinsic exploration techniques, requiring only a fraction of exploration
samples and achieving better asymptotic performance.},

Abstract      = {Research on exploration in reinforcement learning, as applied to Atari 2600
game-playing, has emphasized tackling difficult exploration problems such as
Montezuma's Revenge (Bellemare et al., 2016). Recently, bonus-based exploration
methods, which explore by augmenting the environment reward, have reached
above-human average performance on such domains. In this paper we reassess
popular bonus-based exploration methods within a common evaluation framework.
We combine Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) with different exploration bonuses and
evaluate its performance on Montezuma's Revenge, Bellemare et al.'s set of hard
of exploration games with sparse rewards, and the whole Atari 2600 suite. We
find that while exploration bonuses lead to higher score on Montezuma's Revenge
they do not provide meaningful gains over the simpler $\epsilon$-greedy scheme.
In fact, we find that methods that perform best on that game often underperform
$\epsilon$-greedy on easy exploration Atari 2600 games. We find that our
conclusions remain valid even when hyperparameters are tuned for these
easy-exploration games. Finally, we find that none of the methods surveyed
benefit from additional training samples (1 billion frames, versus Rainbow's
200 million) on Bellemare et al.'s hard exploration games. Our results suggest
that recent gains in Montezuma's Revenge may be better attributed to
architecture change, rather than better exploration schemes; and that the real
pace of progress in exploration research for Atari 2600 games may have been
obfuscated by good results on a single domain.},

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning can acquire complex behaviors from high-level

effectively and encodes the correct task is challenging in practice. We explore
how inverse optimal control (IOC) can be used to learn behaviors from
demonstrations, with applications to torque control of high-dimensional robotic
systems. Our method addresses two key challenges in inverse optimal control:
first, the need for informative features and effective regularization to impose
structure on the cost, and second, the difficulty of learning the cost function
under unknown dynamics for high-dimensional continuous systems. To address the
former challenge, we present an algorithm capable of learning arbitrary
nonlinear cost functions, such as neural networks, without meticulous feature
engineering. To address the latter challenge, we formulate an efficient
sample-based approximation for MaxEnt IOC. We evaluate our method on a series
of simulated tasks and real-world robotic manipulation problems, demonstrating
substantial improvement over prior methods both in terms of task complexity and

human expertise before it can be applied to new problems and domains. To
alleviate this problem, we propose to use automatic hyperparameter optimization
(HPO). We demonstrate that this problem can be tackled effectively with
automated HPO, which we demonstrate to yield significantly improved performance
compared to human experts. In addition, we show that tuning of several MBRL
hyperparameters dynamically, i.e. during the training itself, further improves
the performance compared to using static hyperparameters which are kept fixed
for the whole training. Finally, our experiments provide valuable insights into
the effects of several hyperparameters, such as plan horizon or learning rate

Only a handful of IL algorithms have shown efficiency in the context of an

available. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm designed to imitate
complex robotic tasks from the states of an expert trajectory. Based on a
sequential inductive bias, our method divides the complex task into smaller
skills. The skills are learned into a goal-conditioned policy that is able to
solve each skill individually and chain skills to solve the entire task. We
show that our method imitates a non-holonomic navigation task and scales to a
complex simulated robotic manipulation task with very high sample efficiency.},

Abstract      = {A compelling use case of offline reinforcement learning (RL) is to obtain a
policy initialization from existing datasets followed by fast online
fine-tuning with limited interaction. However, existing offline RL methods tend
to behave poorly during fine-tuning. In this paper, we study the fine-tuning
problem in the context of conservative offline RL methods and we devise an
approach for learning an effective initialization from offline data that also
enables fast online fine-tuning capabilities. Our approach, calibrated
Q-learning (Cal-QL), accomplishes this by learning a conservative value
function initialization that underestimates the value of the learned policy
from offline data, while also ensuring that the learned Q-values are at a
reasonable scale. We refer to this property as calibration, and define it
formally as providing a lower bound on the true value function of the learned
policy and an upper bound on the value of some other (suboptimal) reference
policy, which may simply be the behavior policy. We show that a conservative
offline RL algorithm that also learns a calibrated value function leads to
effective online fine-tuning, enabling us to take the benefits of offline
initializations in online fine-tuning. In practice, Cal-QL can be implemented
on top of the conservative Q learning (CQL) for offline RL within a one-line
code change. Empirically, Cal-QL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 9/11
fine-tuning benchmark tasks that we study in this paper. Code and video are

impractical to generate sufficient training data with real-world experiments.
As an alternative solution, we propose to learn a robot controller in
simulation, with the potential of then transferring this to a real robot.
Building upon the recent success of deep Q-networks, we present an approach
which uses 3D simulations to train a 7-DOF robotic arm in a control task
without any prior knowledge. The controller accepts images of the environment
as its only input, and outputs motor actions for the task of locating and
grasping a cube, over a range of initial configurations. To encourage efficient
learning, a structured reward function is designed with intermediate rewards.
We also present preliminary results in direct transfer of policies over to a

demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to
perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as
stacking blocks with a robot arm. Our method, which builds on top of Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradients and Hindsight Experience Replay, provides an
order of magnitude of speedup over RL on simulated robotics tasks. It is simple
to implement and makes only the additional assumption that we can collect a
small set of demonstrations. Furthermore, our method is able to solve tasks not

it becomes a Riemannian manifold, named the Wasserstein statistical manifold.
In general, it is not a totally geodesic sub-manifold of the density space, and
therefore its geodesics will differ from the Wasserstein geodesics, except for
the well-known Gaussian distribution case, a fact which can also be validated
under our framework. We use the sub-manifold geometry to derive a gradient flow
and natural gradient descent method in the parameter space. When parametrized
densities lie in $\bR$, the induced metric tensor establishes an explicit
formula. In optimization problems, we observe that the natural gradient descent
outperforms the standard gradient descent when the Wasserstein distance is the
objective function. In such a case, we prove that the resulting algorithm
behaves similarly to the Newton method in the asymptotic regime. The proof
calculates the exact Hessian formula for the Wasserstein distance, which
further motivates another preconditioner for the optimization process. To the

Abstract      = {The promise of reinforcement learning is to solve complex sequential decision
problems autonomously by specifying a high-level reward function only. However,
reinforcement learning algorithms struggle when, as is often the case, simple
and intuitive rewards provide sparse and deceptive feedback. Avoiding these
pitfalls requires thoroughly exploring the environment, but creating algorithms
that can do so remains one of the central challenges of the field. We
hypothesise that the main impediment to effective exploration originates from
algorithms forgetting how to reach previously visited states ("detachment") and
from failing to first return to a state before exploring from it
("derailment"). We introduce Go-Explore, a family of algorithms that addresses
these two challenges directly through the simple principles of explicitly
remembering promising states and first returning to such states before
intentionally exploring. Go-Explore solves all heretofore unsolved Atari games
and surpasses the state of the art on all hard-exploration games, with orders
of magnitude improvements on the grand challenges Montezuma's Revenge and
Pitfall. We also demonstrate the practical potential of Go-Explore on a
sparse-reward pick-and-place robotics task. Additionally, we show that adding a
goal-conditioned policy can further improve Go-Explore's exploration efficiency
and enable it to handle stochasticity throughout training. The substantial
performance gains from Go-Explore suggest that the simple principles of
remembering states, returning to them, and exploring from them are a powerful
and general approach to exploration, an insight that may prove critical to the
creation of truly intelligent learning agents.},

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning provides a general framework for flexible decision
making and control, but requires extensive data collection for each new task
that an agent needs to learn. In other machine learning fields, such as natural
language processing or computer vision, pre-training on large, previously
collected datasets to bootstrap learning for new tasks has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to reduce data requirements when learning a new task. In this
paper, we ask the following question: how can we enable similarly useful
pre-training for RL agents? We propose a method for pre-training behavioral
priors that can capture complex input-output relationships observed in
successful trials from a wide range of previously seen tasks, and we show how
this learned prior can be used for rapidly learning new tasks without impeding
the RL agent's ability to try out novel behaviors. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in challenging robotic manipulation domains
involving image observations and sparse reward functions, where our method
outperforms prior works by a substantial margin.},

Abstract      = {Deep Q-Learning (DQL), a family of temporal difference algorithms for

reinforcement learning: bootstrapping, off-policy learning, and function
approximation. Prior work has demonstrated that together these can lead to
divergence in Q-learning algorithms, but the conditions under which divergence
occurs are not well-understood. In this note, we give a simple analysis based
on a linear approximation to the Q-value updates, which we believe provides
insight into divergence under the deadly triad. The central point in our
analysis is to consider when the leading order approximation to the deep-Q
update is or is not a contraction in the sup norm. Based on this analysis, we
develop an algorithm which permits stable deep Q-learning for continuous
control without any of the tricks conventionally used (such as target networks,
adaptive gradient optimizers, or using multiple Q functions). We demonstrate
that our algorithm performs above or near state-of-the-art on standard MuJoCo

different rates for different discretizations, leading to a number of learning
challenges for off-the-shelf offline RL. We present a simple yet effective
solution that enforces consistency in the rate of $Q$-value updates to
stabilize learning. By scaling the value of $N$ in $N$-step returns with the
discretization size, we effectively balance $Q$-value propagation, leading to
more stable convergence. On three simulated robotic control problems, we

particular kind of representation learning where learned features are in low

by the agent's actions; this kind of representation is particularly suitable

Abstract      = {Intelligent agents rely heavily on prior experience when learning a new task,
yet most modern reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn every task from
scratch. One approach for leveraging prior knowledge is to transfer skills
learned on prior tasks to the new task. However, as the amount of prior
experience increases, the number of transferable skills grows too, making it
challenging to explore the full set of available skills during downstream
learning. Yet, intuitively, not all skills should be explored with equal
probability; for example information about the current state can hint which
skills are promising to explore. In this work, we propose to implement this
intuition by learning a prior over skills. We propose a deep latent variable
model that jointly learns an embedding space of skills and the skill prior from
offline agent experience. We then extend common maximum-entropy RL approaches
to use skill priors to guide downstream learning. We validate our approach,
SPiRL (Skill-Prior RL), on complex navigation and robotic manipulation tasks
and show that learned skill priors are essential for effective skill transfer

Abstract      = {We study continuous action reinforcement learning problems in which it is
crucial that the agent interacts with the environment only through safe
policies, i.e.,~policies that do not take the agent to undesirable situations.
We formulate these problems as constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs)
and present safe policy optimization algorithms that are based on a Lyapunov
approach to solve them. Our algorithms can use any standard policy gradient
(PG) method, such as deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) or proximal
policy optimization (PPO), to train a neural network policy, while guaranteeing
near-constraint satisfaction for every policy update by projecting either the
policy parameter or the action onto the set of feasible solutions induced by
the state-dependent linearized Lyapunov constraints. Compared to the existing
constrained PG algorithms, ours are more data efficient as they are able to
utilize both on-policy and off-policy data. Moreover, our action-projection
algorithm often leads to less conservative policy updates and allows for
natural integration into an end-to-end PG training pipeline. We evaluate our
algorithms and compare them with the state-of-the-art baselines on several

problem, demonstrating their effectiveness in terms of balancing performance

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning requires manual specification of a reward function to
learn a task. While in principle this reward function only needs to specify the
task goal, in practice reinforcement learning can be very time-consuming or
even infeasible unless the reward function is shaped so as to provide a smooth
gradient towards a successful outcome. This shaping is difficult to specify by
hand, particularly when the task is learned from raw observations, such as
images. In this paper, we study how we can automatically learn dynamical
distances: a measure of the expected number of time steps to reach a given goal
state from any other state. These dynamical distances can be used to provide
well-shaped reward functions for reaching new goals, making it possible to
learn complex tasks efficiently. We show that dynamical distances can be used
in a semi-supervised regime, where unsupervised interaction with the
environment is used to learn the dynamical distances, while a small amount of
preference supervision is used to determine the task goal, without any manually
engineered reward function or goal examples. We evaluate our method both on a
real-world robot and in simulation. We show that our method can learn to turn a
valve with a real-world 9-DoF hand, using raw image observations and just ten
preference labels, without any other supervision. Videos of the learned skills

Abstract      = {Autonomous agents that must exhibit flexible and broad capabilities will need
to be equipped with large repertoires of skills. Defining each skill with a

automate this process, but designing appropriate goal setting objectives can be
difficult, and often involves heuristic design decisions. In this paper, we
propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that
maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to
maximizing goal reaching performance together with the entropy of the goal
distribution, where goals correspond to full state observations. To instantiate
this principle, we present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning a
maximum-entropy goal distributions. We prove that, under regularity conditions,
Skew-Fit converges to a uniform distribution over the set of valid states, even
when we do not know this set beforehand. Our experiments show that combining
Skew-Fit for learning goal distributions with existing goal-reaching methods
outperforms a variety of prior methods on open-sourced visual goal-reaching

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved impressive performance in a variety
of online settings in which an agent's ability to query the environment for
transitions and rewards is effectively unlimited. However, in many practical
applications, the situation is reversed: an agent may have access to large
amounts of undirected offline experience data, while access to the online
environment is severely limited. In this work, we focus on this offline
setting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of
a variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a
continuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors
before using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives
extracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are
supported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding
distributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal
abstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in
theory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline
policy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this
way can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as
exploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.

that input tokens retain to a large degree their identity across the model. We
also find evidence suggesting that identity information is mainly encoded in
the angle of the embeddings and gradually decreases with depth. Finally, we
demonstrate strong mixing of input information in the generation of contextual

Abstract      = {In this paper we present a novel probabilistic sampling-based motion planning
algorithm called the Fast Marching Tree algorithm (FMT*). The algorithm is
specifically aimed at solving complex motion planning problems in
high-dimensional configuration spaces. This algorithm is proven to be
asymptotically optimal and is shown to converge to an optimal solution faster
than its state-of-the-art counterparts, chiefly PRM* and RRT*. The FMT*
algorithm performs a "lazy" dynamic programming recursion on a predetermined
number of probabilistically-drawn samples to grow a tree of paths, which moves
steadily outward in cost-to-arrive space. As a departure from previous analysis
approaches that are based on the notion of almost sure convergence, the FMT*
algorithm is analyzed under the notion of convergence in probability: the extra
mathematical flexibility of this approach allows for convergence rate
bounds--the first in the field of optimal sampling-based motion planning.
Specifically, for a certain selection of tuning parameters and configuration
spaces, we obtain a convergence rate bound of order $O(n^{-1/d+\rho})$, where
$n$ is the number of sampled points, $d$ is the dimension of the configuration
space, and $\rho$ is an arbitrarily small constant. We go on to demonstrate
asymptotic optimality for a number of variations on FMT*, namely when the
configuration space is sampled non-uniformly, when the cost is not arc length,

Abstract      = {Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a range of
challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural
network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of
model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function
approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this
paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample
complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We
propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such
algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm,
which we call normalized adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the
more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation
allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and
substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks.
To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of
learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that
iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and
demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are
applicable.},

Abstract      = {A major challenge in reinforcement learning is the design of exploration
strategies, especially for environments with sparse reward structures and
continuous state and action spaces. Intuitively, if the reinforcement signal is
very scarce, the agent should rely on some form of short-term memory in order
to cover its environment efficiently. We propose a new exploration method,
based on two intuitions: (1) the choice of the next exploratory action should
depend not only on the (Markovian) state of the environment, but also on the
agent's trajectory so far, and (2) the agent should utilize a measure of spread
in the state space to avoid getting stuck in a small region. Our method
leverages concepts often used in statistical physics to provide explanations
for the behavior of simplified (polymer) chains in order to generate persistent
(locally self-avoiding) trajectories in state space. We discuss the theoretical
properties of locally self-avoiding walks and their ability to provide a kind
of short-term memory through a decaying temporal correlation within the
trajectory. We provide empirical evaluations of our approach in a simulated 2D
navigation task, as well as higher-dimensional MuJoCo continuous control
locomotion tasks with sparse rewards.},

control laws by solving an optimal control problem (OCP) in either a
model-based or data-driven manner. However, solving the most general of these
problems online remains intractable due to complexities from intermittent
unidirectional contacts with the environment, and from the many degrees of
freedom of legged robots. This survey covers methods that have been pursued to
make these OCPs computationally tractable, with specific focus on how
environmental contacts are treated, how the model can be simplified, and how
these choices affect the numerical solution methods employed. The survey
focuses on model-based optimization, covering its recent use in a stand alone

Abstract      = {The exploration-exploitation trade-off is at the heart of reinforcement
learning (RL). However, most continuous control benchmarks used in recent RL
research only require local exploration. This led to the development of
algorithms that have basic exploration capabilities, and behave poorly in
benchmarks that require more versatile exploration. For instance, as
demonstrated in our empirical study, state-of-the-art RL algorithms such as
DDPG and TD3 are unable to steer a point mass in even small 2D mazes. In this
paper, we propose a new algorithm called "Plan, Backplay, Chain Skills" (PBCS)
that combines motion planning and reinforcement learning to solve hard
exploration environments. In a first phase, a motion planning algorithm is used
to find a single good trajectory, then an RL algorithm is trained using a
curriculum derived from the trajectory, by combining a variant of the Backplay
algorithm and skill chaining. We show that this method outperforms
state-of-the-art RL algorithms in 2D maze environments of various sizes, and is
able to improve on the trajectory obtained by the motion planning phase.},

Abstract      = {Discrete-action algorithms have been central to numerous recent successes of
deep reinforcement learning. However, applying these algorithms to
high-dimensional action tasks requires tackling the combinatorial increase of
the number of possible actions with the number of action dimensions. This
problem is further exacerbated for continuous-action tasks that require fine
control of actions via discretization. In this paper, we propose a novel neural
architecture featuring a shared decision module followed by several network
branches, one for each action dimension. This approach achieves a linear
increase of the number of network outputs with the number of degrees of freedom
by allowing a level of independence for each individual action dimension. To
illustrate the approach, we present a novel agent, called Branching Dueling
Q-Network (BDQ), as a branching variant of the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network
(Dueling DDQN). We evaluate the performance of our agent on a set of
challenging continuous control tasks. The empirical results show that the
proposed agent scales gracefully to environments with increasing action
dimensionality and indicate the significance of the shared decision module in
coordination of the distributed action branches. Furthermore, we show that the
proposed agent performs competitively against a state-of-the-art continuous
control algorithm, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).},

Abstract      = {Sample efficiency and exploration remain major challenges in online

these issues is the inclusion of offline data, such as prior trajectories from

relied on extensive modifications and additional complexity to ensure the
effective use of this data. Instead, we ask: can we simply apply existing
off-policy methods to leverage offline data when learning online? In this work,
we demonstrate that the answer is yes; however, a set of minimal but important
changes to existing off-policy RL algorithms are required to achieve reliable
performance. We extensively ablate these design choices, demonstrating the key
factors that most affect performance, and arrive at a set of recommendations
that practitioners can readily apply, whether their data comprise a small
number of expert demonstrations or large volumes of sub-optimal trajectories.
We see that correct application of these simple recommendations can provide a

Abstract      = {Adversarial Imitation Learning alternates between learning a discriminator --

This alternated optimization is known to be delicate in practice since it
compounds unstable adversarial training with brittle and sample-inefficient
reinforcement learning. We propose to remove the burden of the policy
optimization steps by leveraging a novel discriminator formulation.
Specifically, our discriminator is explicitly conditioned on two policies: the
one from the previous generator's iteration and a learnable policy. When
optimized, this discriminator directly learns the optimal generator's policy.
Consequently, our discriminator's update solves the generator's optimization
problem for free: learning a policy that imitates the expert does not require
an additional optimization loop. This formulation effectively cuts by half the
implementation and computational burden of Adversarial Imitation Learning
algorithms by removing the Reinforcement Learning phase altogether. We show on
a variety of tasks that our simpler approach is competitive to prevalent

However, naively performing such initialization in RL often works poorly,
especially for value-based methods. In this paper, we present a meta algorithm
that can use offline data, demonstrations, or a pre-existing policy to
initialize an RL policy, and is compatible with any RL approach. In particular,
we propose Jump-Start Reinforcement Learning (JSRL), an algorithm that employs
two policies to solve tasks: a guide-policy, and an exploration-policy. By
using the guide-policy to form a curriculum of starting states for the
exploration-policy, we are able to efficiently improve performance on a set of
simulated robotic tasks. We show via experiments that JSRL is able to
significantly outperform existing imitation and reinforcement learning
algorithms, particularly in the small-data regime. In addition, we provide an

unsupervised skill discovery that maximizes the mutual information between
state-transitions and latent skill vectors. CIC utilizes contrastive learning
between state-transitions and skills to learn behavior embeddings and maximizes
the entropy of these embeddings as an intrinsic reward to encourage behavioral
diversity. We evaluate our algorithm on the Unsupervised Reinforcement Learning
Benchmark, which consists of a long reward-free pre-training phase followed by
a short adaptation phase to downstream tasks with extrinsic rewards. CIC
substantially improves over prior methods in terms of adaptation efficiency,
outperforming prior unsupervised skill discovery methods by 1.79x and the next
leading overall exploration algorithm by 1.18x.},

Abstract      = {Many potential applications of reinforcement learning (RL) require guarantees
that the agent will perform well in the face of disturbances to the dynamics or
reward function. In this paper, we prove theoretically that maximum entropy
(MaxEnt) RL maximizes a lower bound on a robust RL objective, and thus can be
used to learn policies that are robust to some disturbances in the dynamics and
the reward function. While this capability of MaxEnt RL has been observed
empirically in prior work, to the best of our knowledge our work provides the
first rigorous proof and theoretical characterization of the MaxEnt RL robust
set. While a number of prior robust RL algorithms have been designed to handle
similar disturbances to the reward function or dynamics, these methods
typically require additional moving parts and hyperparameters on top of a base
RL algorithm. In contrast, our results suggest that MaxEnt RL by itself is
robust to certain disturbances, without requiring any additional modifications.
While this does not imply that MaxEnt RL is the best available robust RL
method, MaxEnt RL is a simple robust RL method with appealing formal
guarantees.},

pushing, sliding, and pick-and-place, in each case using only binary rewards

Hindsight Experience Replay is a crucial ingredient which makes training
possible in these challenging environments. We show that our policies trained

agents are tasked with learning multiple skills by sharing information. Our
method uses the skills that were learned by both agents to train invariant
feature spaces that can then be used to transfer other skills from one agent to
another. The process of learning these invariant feature spaces can be viewed
as a kind of "analogy making", or implicit learning of partial correspondences
between two distinct domains. We evaluate our transfer learning algorithm in
two simulated robotic manipulation skills, and illustrate that we can transfer
knowledge between simulated robotic arms with different numbers of links, as
well as simulated arms with different actuation mechanisms, where one robot is
torque-driven while the other is tendon-driven.},

Abstract      = {Demonstration-guided reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for
learning complex behaviors by leveraging both reward feedback and a set of

completely unseen behavior by following the demonstrator's exact muscle
movements. Naturally, such learning will be slow, but often new behaviors are
not completely unseen: they share subtasks with behaviors we have previously
learned. In this work, we aim to exploit this shared subtask structure to
increase the efficiency of demonstration-guided RL. We first learn a set of
reusable skills from large offline datasets of prior experience collected
across many tasks. We then propose Skill-based Learning with Demonstrations
(SkiLD), an algorithm for demonstration-guided RL that efficiently leverages
the provided demonstrations by following the demonstrated skills instead of the
primitive actions, resulting in substantial performance improvements over prior
demonstration-guided RL approaches. We validate the effectiveness of our

higher bias. In this paper, we argue that the larger bias of TD can be a result
of the amplification of local approximation errors. We address this by
proposing an algorithm that adaptively switches between TD and MC in each
state, thus mitigating the propagation of errors. Our method is based on
learned confidence intervals that detect biases of TD estimates. We demonstrate
in a variety of policy evaluation tasks that this simple adaptive algorithm
performs competitively with the best approach in hindsight, suggesting that
learned confidence intervals are a powerful technique for adapting policy
evaluation to use TD or MC returns in a data-driven way.},

if trends found in oracle settings hold true with modern deep RL methods. We
find that large neural network architectures have many benefits with regards to

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Offline reinforcement learning requires reconciling two conflicting aims:
learning a policy that improves over the behavior policy that collected the
dataset, while at the same time minimizing the deviation from the behavior
policy so as to avoid errors due to distributional shift. This trade-off is
critical, because most current offline reinforcement learning methods need to
query the value of unseen actions during training to improve the policy, and
therefore need to either constrain these actions to be in-distribution, or else
regularize their values. We propose an offline RL method that never needs to
evaluate actions outside of the dataset, but still enables the learned policy
to improve substantially over the best behavior in the data through
generalization. The main insight in our work is that, instead of evaluating
unseen actions from the latest policy, we can approximate the policy
improvement step implicitly by treating the state value function as a random
variable, with randomness determined by the action (while still integrating
over the dynamics to avoid excessive optimism), and then taking a state
conditional upper expectile of this random variable to estimate the value of
the best actions in that state. This leverages the generalization capacity of
the function approximator to estimate the value of the best available action at
a given state without ever directly querying a Q-function with this unseen
action. Our algorithm alternates between fitting this upper expectile value
function and backing it up into a Q-function. Then, we extract the policy via
advantage-weighted behavioral cloning. We dub our method implicit Q-learning
(IQL). IQL demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on D4RL, a standard
benchmark for offline reinforcement learning. We also demonstrate that IQL
achieves strong performance fine-tuning using online interaction after offline
initialization.},

Abstract      = {Many fields use search algorithms, which automatically explore a search space

molecules to discover new drugs; engineers search for stronger, cheaper, safer
designs, scientists search for models that best explain data, etc. The goal of
search algorithms has traditionally been to return the single
highest-performing solution in a search space. Here we describe a new,
fundamentally different type of algorithm that is more useful because it
provides a holistic view of how high-performing solutions are distributed
throughout a search space. It creates a map of high-performing solutions at
each point in a space defined by dimensions of variation that a user gets to
choose. This Multi-dimensional Archive of Phenotypic Elites (MAP-Elites)
algorithm illuminates search spaces, allowing researchers to understand how
interesting attributes of solutions combine to affect performance, either
positively or, equally of interest, negatively. For example, a drug company may
wish to understand how performance changes as the size of molecules and their
cost-to-produce vary. MAP-Elites produces a large diversity of high-performing,
yet qualitatively different solutions, which can be more helpful than a single,
high-performing solution. Interestingly, because MAP-Elites explores more of
the search space, it also tends to find a better overall solution than
state-of-the-art search algorithms. We demonstrate the benefits of this new
algorithm in three different problem domains ranging from producing modular
neural networks to designing simulated and real soft robots. Because MAP-
Elites (1) illuminates the relationship between performance and dimensions of
interest in solutions, (2) returns a set of high-performing, yet diverse

science and engineering.},

estimator, and analyze this phenomenon through the lens of bias and variance.
We additionally propose an $\alpha$-order gradient estimator, with $\alpha \in
[0,1]$, which correctly utilizes exact gradients to combine the efficiency of
first-order estimates with the robustness of zero-order methods. We demonstrate
the pitfalls of traditional estimators and the advantages of the $\alpha$-order

Abstract      = {We consider neural networks with a single hidden layer and non-decreasing

the number of hidden units grow unbounded and using classical non-Euclidean
regularization tools on the output weights, we provide a detailed theoretical
analysis of their generalization performance, with a study of both the
approximation and the estimation errors. We show in particular that they are
adaptive to unknown underlying linear structures, such as the dependence on the
projection of the input variables onto a low-dimensional subspace. Moreover,
when using sparsity-inducing norms on the input weights, we show that
high-dimensional non-linear variable selection may be achieved, without any
strong assumption regarding the data and with a total number of variables
potentially exponential in the number of ob-servations. In addition, we provide
a simple geometric interpretation to the non-convex problem of addition of a
new unit, which is the core potentially hard computational element in the
framework of learning from continuously many basis functions. We provide simple
conditions for convex relaxations to achieve the same generalization error
bounds, even when constant-factor approxi-mations cannot be found (e.g.,
because it is NP-hard such as for the zero-homogeneous activation function). We
were not able to find strong enough convex relaxations and leave open the
existence or non-existence of polynomial-time algorithms.},

Abstract      = {Humans are able to perform a myriad of sophisticated tasks by drawing upon
skills acquired through prior experience. For autonomous agents to have this
capability, they must be able to extract reusable skills from past experience
that can be recombined in new ways for subsequent tasks. Furthermore, when
controlling complex high-dimensional morphologies, such as humanoid bodies,
tasks often require coordination of multiple skills simultaneously. Learning
discrete primitives for every combination of skills quickly becomes
prohibitive. Composable primitives that can be recombined to create a large
variety of behaviors can be more suitable for modeling this combinatorial
explosion. In this work, we propose multiplicative compositional policies
(MCP), a method for learning reusable motor skills that can be composed to
produce a range of complex behaviors. Our method factorizes an agent's skills
into a collection of primitives, where multiple primitives can be activated
simultaneously via multiplicative composition. This flexibility allows the
primitives to be transferred and recombined to elicit new behaviors as
necessary for novel tasks. We demonstrate that MCP is able to extract
composable skills for highly complex simulated characters from pre-training
tasks, such as motion imitation, and then reuse these skills to solve
challenging continuous control tasks, such as dribbling a soccer ball to a
goal, and picking up an object and transporting it to a target location.},

Abstract      = {Understanding why a model makes a certain prediction can be as crucial as the
prediction's accuracy in many applications. However, the highest accuracy for
large modern datasets is often achieved by complex models that even experts
struggle to interpret, such as ensemble or deep learning models, creating a
tension between accuracy and interpretability. In response, various methods
have recently been proposed to help users interpret the predictions of complex
models, but it is often unclear how these methods are related and when one
method is preferable over another. To address this problem, we present a
unified framework for interpreting predictions, SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations). SHAP assigns each feature an importance value for a particular
prediction. Its novel components include: (1) the identification of a new class
of additive feature importance measures, and (2) theoretical results showing
there is a unique solution in this class with a set of desirable properties.
The new class unifies six existing methods, notable because several recent
methods in the class lack the proposed desirable properties. Based on insights
from this unification, we present new methods that show improved computational
performance and/or better consistency with human intuition than previous
approaches.},

Abstract      = {Dropped into an unknown environment, what should an agent do to quickly learn
about the environment and how to accomplish diverse tasks within it? We address
this question within the goal-conditioned reinforcement learning paradigm, by
identifying how the agent should set its goals at training time to maximize
exploration. We propose "Planning Exploratory Goals" (PEG), a method that sets
goals for each training episode to directly optimize an intrinsic exploration
reward. PEG first chooses goal commands such that the agent's goal-conditioned
policy, at its current level of training, will end up in states with high
exploration potential. It then launches an exploration policy starting at those
promising states. To enable this direct optimization, PEG learns world models
and adapts sampling-based planning algorithms to "plan goal commands". In
challenging simulated robotics environments including a multi-legged ant robot
in a maze, and a robot arm on a cluttered tabletop, PEG exploration enables
more efficient and effective training of goal-conditioned policies relative to
baselines and ablations. Our ant successfully navigates a long maze, and the
robot arm successfully builds a stack of three blocks upon command. Website:

the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict
future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling.

using only RGB vision-based perception from an over-the-shoulder camera, our

Abstract      = {Animals are capable of precise and agile locomotion using vision. Replicating
this ability has been a long-standing goal in robotics. The traditional
approach has been to decompose this problem into elevation mapping and foothold
planning phases. The elevation mapping, however, is susceptible to failure and
large noise artifacts, requires specialized hardware, and is biologically
implausible. In this paper, we present the first end-to-end locomotion system
capable of traversing stairs, curbs, stepping stones, and gaps. We show this
result on a medium-sized quadruped robot using a single front-facing depth
camera. The small size of the robot necessitates discovering specialized gait
patterns not seen elsewhere. The egocentric camera requires the policy to
remember past information to estimate the terrain under its hind feet. We train
our policy in simulation. Training has two phases - first, we train a policy
using reinforcement learning with a cheap-to-compute variant of depth image and
then in phase 2 distill it into the final policy that uses depth using
supervised learning. The resulting policy transfers to the real world and is
able to run in real-time on the limited compute of the robot. It can traverse a
large variety of terrain while being robust to perturbations like pushes,
slippery surfaces, and rocky terrain. Videos are at

struggle in temporally extended tasks with sparse external rewards, since the
high-level policy learning relies on external rewards. As the high-level policy
selects subgoals in an online learned representation space, the dynamic change
of the subgoal space severely hinders effective high-level exploration. In this
paper, we propose a novel regularization that contributes to both stable and
efficient subgoal representation learning. Building upon the stable
representation, we design measures of novelty and potential for subgoals, and
develop an active hierarchical exploration strategy that seeks out new

maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at

off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our

adversarial training to produce tasks that are always at the appropriate level

curriculum of tasks for the agent to learn. We show that, by using this

self-supervised learning, is sufficient to produce a multimodal interactive
agent, which we call MIA, that successfully interacts with non-adversarial
humans 75% of the time. We further identify architectural and algorithmic

Abstract      = {Weight decay is one of the standard tricks in the neural network toolbox, but
the reasons for its regularization effect are poorly understood, and recent
results have cast doubt on the traditional interpretation in terms of $L_2$
regularization. Literal weight decay has been shown to outperform $L_2$
regularization for optimizers for which they differ. We empirically investigate
weight decay for three optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, and K-FAC) and a
variety of network architectures. We identify three distinct mechanisms by
which weight decay exerts a regularization effect, depending on the particular
optimization algorithm and architecture: (1) increasing the effective learning
rate, (2) approximately regularizing the input-output Jacobian norm, and (3)
reducing the effective damping coefficient for second-order optimization. Our
results provide insight into how to improve the regularization of neural
networks.},

Abstract      = {Despite their overwhelming capacity to overfit, deep learning architectures

research. One standing hypothesis that is gaining popularity, e.g. Hochreiter &
Schmidhuber (1997); Keskar et al. (2017), is that the flatness of minima of the
loss function found by stochastic gradient based methods results in good
generalization. This paper argues that most notions of flatness are problematic
for deep models and can not be directly applied to explain generalization.
Specifically, when focusing on deep networks with rectifier units, we can
exploit the particular geometry of parameter space induced by the inherent
symmetries that these architectures exhibit to build equivalent models
corresponding to arbitrarily sharper minima. Furthermore, if we allow to
reparametrize a function, the geometry of its parameters can change drastically
without affecting its generalization properties.},

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Deep reinforcement learning can learn effective policies for a wide range of
tasks, but is notoriously difficult to use due to instability and sensitivity
to hyperparameters. The reasons for this remain unclear. When using standard
supervised methods (e.g., for bandits), on-policy data collection provides
"hard negatives" that correct the model in precisely those states and actions
that the policy is likely to visit. We call this phenomenon "corrective
feedback." We show that bootstrapping-based Q-learning algorithms do not
necessarily benefit from this corrective feedback, and training on the
experience collected by the algorithm is not sufficient to correct errors in
the Q-function. In fact, Q-learning and related methods can exhibit
pathological interactions between the distribution of experience collected by
the agent and the policy induced by training on that experience, leading to
potential instability, sub-optimal convergence, and poor results when learning
from noisy, sparse or delayed rewards. We demonstrate the existence of this
problem, both theoretically and empirically. We then show that a specific
correction to the data distribution can mitigate this issue. Based on these
observations, we propose a new algorithm, DisCor, which computes an
approximation to this optimal distribution and uses it to re-weight the
transitions used for training, resulting in substantial improvements in a range
of challenging RL settings, such as multi-task learning and learning from noisy
reward signals. Blog post presenting a summary of this work is available at:

proposed method on deep neural networks, and compare its performance to widely
used methods such as stochastic gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent
and L-BFGS, and also to HF. Our method leads to faster convergence than either
L-BFGS or HF, and generally performs better than either of them in
cross-validation accuracy. It is also simpler and more general than HF, as it
does not require a positive semi-definite approximation of the Hessian matrix

Comparatively, less attention has been paid to interpreting deep learning

we introduce a principled mechanism to terminate sample collection once we have
a rich enough trajectory batch to improve the model. We rigorously evaluate our

Abstract      = {Learning robotic manipulation tasks using reinforcement learning with sparse

the absence of inductive biases for transferring knowledge from simpler to
complex tasks. We show that graph-based relational architectures overcome this
limitation and enable learning of complex tasks when provided with a simple
curriculum of tasks with increasing numbers of objects. We demonstrate the
utility of our framework on a simulated block stacking task. Starting from

step-wise sparse rewards, our method is orders of magnitude more data-efficient
and outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method that utilizes human

that most of the observed benefits of hierarchy can be attributed to improved

Abstract      = {Reinforcement learning (RL) provides an appealing formalism for learning
control policies from experience. However, the classic active formulation of RL
necessitates a lengthy active exploration process for each behavior, making it
difficult to apply in real-world settings such as robotic control. If we can
instead allow RL algorithms to effectively use previously collected data to aid
the online learning process, such applications could be made substantially more
practical: the prior data would provide a starting point that mitigates
challenges due to exploration and sample complexity, while the online training
enables the agent to perfect the desired skill. Such prior data could either
constitute expert demonstrations or sub-optimal prior data that illustrates
potentially useful transitions. While a number of prior methods have either
used optimal demonstrations to bootstrap RL, or have used sub-optimal data to
train purely offline, it remains exceptionally difficult to train a policy with
offline data and actually continue to improve it further with online RL. In
this paper we analyze why this problem is so challenging, and propose an
algorithm that combines sample efficient dynamic programming with maximum
likelihood policy updates, providing a simple and effective framework that is
able to leverage large amounts of offline data and then quickly perform online
fine-tuning of RL policies. We show that our method, advantage weighted actor

successes in various sequential decision making tasks, leveraging advances in
methods for training large deep networks. However, these methods usually
require large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for
real-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good
representations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better
policies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality
helps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL
algorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet)
that uses neural nets to produce good representations to be used as inputs to
deep RL algorithms. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually
supposed to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL
agents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation
than with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger
feature propagation together with larger networks (and thus larger search
space) allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus
improves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the
proposed method outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms

Abstract      = {Learning complex robot behaviors through interaction requires structured
exploration. Planning should target interactions with the potential to optimize
long-term performance, while only reducing uncertainty where conducive to this
objective. This paper presents Latent Optimistic Value Exploration (LOVE), a
strategy that enables deep exploration through optimism in the face of
uncertain long-term rewards. We combine latent world models with value function
estimation to predict infinite-horizon returns and recover associated
uncertainty via ensembling. The policy is then trained on an upper confidence
bound (UCB) objective to identify and select the interactions most promising to
improve long-term performance. We apply LOVE to visual robot control tasks in
continuous action spaces and demonstrate on average more than 20% improved
sample efficiency in comparison to state-of-the-art and other exploration
objectives. In sparse and hard to explore environments we achieve an average
improvement of over 30%.},

Abstract      = {Off-policy reinforcement learning aims to leverage experience collected from
prior policies for sample-efficient learning. However, in practice, commonly
used off-policy approximate dynamic programming methods based on Q-learning and
actor-critic methods are highly sensitive to the data distribution, and can
make only limited progress without collecting additional on-policy data. As a
step towards more robust off-policy algorithms, we study the setting where the
off-policy experience is fixed and there is no further interaction with the
environment. We identify bootstrapping error as a key source of instability in
current methods. Bootstrapping error is due to bootstrapping from actions that
lie outside of the training data distribution, and it accumulates via the
Bellman backup operator. We theoretically analyze bootstrapping error, and
demonstrate how carefully constraining action selection in the backup can
mitigate it. Based on our analysis, we propose a practical algorithm,
bootstrapping error accumulation reduction (BEAR). We demonstrate that BEAR is
able to learn robustly from different off-policy distributions, including
random and suboptimal demonstrations, on a range of continuous control tasks.},

To study this problem, we develop a notion of sub-optimality of a

policy using this representation. We derive expressions which bound the
sub-optimality and show how these expressions can be translated to
representation learning objectives which may be optimized in practice. Results

performance in domains ranging from video games to simulated robotic

poorly when the interaction time with the environment is limited, as is the
case for most real-world robotic tasks. In this paper, we study how maximum
entropy policies trained using soft Q-learning can be applied to real-world
robotic manipulation. The application of this method to real-world manipulation
is facilitated by two important features of soft Q-learning. First, soft
Q-learning can learn multimodal exploration strategies by learning policies
represented by expressive energy-based models. Second, we show that policies
learned with soft Q-learning can be composed to create new policies, and that
the optimality of the resulting policy can be bounded in terms of the
divergence between the composed policies. This compositionality provides an
especially valuable tool for real-world manipulation, where constructing new
policies by composing existing skills can provide a large gain in efficiency
over training from scratch. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that soft
Q-learning is substantially more sample efficient than prior model-free deep
reinforcement learning methods, and that compositionality can be performed for
both simulated and real-world tasks.},

our field of interest, state representation learning (SRL). Indeed, a compact

strong impact on the adaptive capability of the agent. In this article we
present an approach based on imitation learning. The idea is to train several
policies that share the same representation to reproduce various
demonstrations. To do so, we use a multi-head neural network with a shared
state representation feeding a task-specific agent. If the demonstrations are
diverse, the trained representation will eventually contain the information
necessary for all tasks, while discarding irrelevant information. As such, it
will potentially become a compact state representation useful for new tasks. We
call this approach SRLfD (State Representation Learning from Demonstration).
Our experiments confirm that when a controller takes SRLfD-based
representations as input, it can achieve better performance than with other
representation strategies and promote more efficient reinforcement learning

As a result, the original safety set can be forward-invariant. However, because
the new guaranteed-feasible constraints are imposed on the updating dynamics
instead of the original policy parameters, classic optimization algorithms are
no longer applicable. To address this, we propose to learn a generic deep
neural network (DNN)-based optimizer to optimize the objective while satisfying
the linear constraints. The constraint-satisfaction is achieved via projection
onto a polytope formulated by multiple linear inequality constraints, which can
be solved analytically with our newly designed metric. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the \textit{first} DNN-based optimizer for constrained
optimization with the forward invariance guarantee. We show that our optimizer
trains a policy to decrease the constraint violation and maximize the
cumulative reward monotonically. Results on numerical constrained optimization

Abstract      = {Background Precise prediction of cancer types is vital for cancer diagnosis
and therapy. Important cancer marker genes can be inferred through predictive
model. Several studies have attempted to build machine learning models for this
task however none has taken into consideration the effects of tissue of origin
that can potentially bias the identification of cancer markers. Results In this
paper, we introduced several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models that
take unstructured gene expression inputs to classify tumor and non-tumor
samples into their designated cancer types or as normal. Based on different
designs of gene embeddings and convolution schemes, we implemented three CNN
models: 1D-CNN, 2D-Vanilla-CNN, and 2D-Hybrid-CNN. The models were trained and
tested on combined 10,340 samples of 33 cancer types and 731 matched normal
tissues of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Our models achieved excellent
prediction accuracies (93.9-95.0%) among 34 classes (33 cancers and normal).
Furthermore, we interpreted one of the models, known as 1D-CNN model, with a
guided saliency technique and identified a total of 2,090 cancer markers (108
per class). The concordance of differential expression of these markers between
the cancer type they represent and others is confirmed. In breast cancer, for
instance, our model identified well-known markers, such as GATA3 and ESR1.
Finally, we extended the 1D-CNN model for prediction of breast cancer subtypes
and achieved an average accuracy of 88.42% among 5 subtypes. The codes can be

Abstract      = {A fascinating aspect of nature lies in its ability to produce a large and
diverse collection of organisms that are all high-performing in their niche. By
contrast, most AI algorithms focus on finding a single efficient solution to a
given problem. Aiming for diversity in addition to performance is a convenient
way to deal with the exploration-exploitation trade-off that plays a central
role in learning. It also allows for increased robustness when the returned
collection contains several working solutions to the considered problem, making
it well-suited for real applications such as robotics. Quality-Diversity (QD)
methods are evolutionary algorithms designed for this purpose. This paper
proposes a novel algorithm, QDPG, which combines the strength of Policy
Gradient algorithms and Quality Diversity approaches to produce a collection of
diverse and high-performing neural policies in continuous control environments.
The main contribution of this work is the introduction of a Diversity Policy
Gradient (DPG) that exploits information at the time-step level to drive
policies towards more diversity in a sample-efficient manner. Specifically,
QDPG selects neural controllers from a MAP-Elites grid and uses two
gradient-based mutation operators to improve both quality and diversity. Our
results demonstrate that QDPG is significantly more sample-efficient than its
evolutionary competitors.},

efficient, we propose a method of improving computational efficiency called
DroQ, which is a variant of REDQ that uses a small ensemble of dropout
Q-functions. Our dropout Q-functions are simple Q-functions equipped with
dropout connection and layer normalization. Despite its simplicity of
implementation, our experimental results indicate that DroQ is doubly (sample

REDQ, much better computational efficiency than REDQ, and comparable
computational efficiency with that of SAC.},

explore how a rich environment can help to promote the learning of complex

find that this encourages the emergence of robust behaviours that perform well

behaviours that are known for their sensitivity to the choice of reward. We
train several simulated bodies on a diverse set of challenging terrains and
obstacles, using a simple reward function based on forward progress. Using a
novel scalable variant of policy gradient reinforcement learning, our agents
learn to run, jump, crouch and turn as required by the environment without

Abstract      = {While using shaped rewards can be beneficial when solving sparse reward
tasks, their successful application often requires careful engineering and is
problem specific. For instance, in tasks where the agent must achieve some goal

learning vulnerable to local optima. We introduce a simple and effective
model-free method to learn from shaped distance-to-goal rewards on tasks where
success depends on reaching a goal state. Our method introduces an auxiliary
distance-based reward based on pairs of rollouts to encourage diverse
exploration. This approach effectively prevents learning dynamics from
stabilizing around local optima induced by the naive distance-to-goal reward
shaping and enables policies to efficiently solve sparse reward tasks. Our
augmented objective does not require any additional reward engineering or
domain expertise to implement and converges to the original sparse objective as
the agent learns to solve the task. We demonstrate that our method successfully
solves a variety of hard-exploration tasks (including maze navigation and 3D
construction in a Minecraft environment), where naive distance-based reward
shaping otherwise fails, and intrinsic curiosity and reward relabeling
strategies exhibit poor performance.},

Abstract      = {Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words of
the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in
hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of
the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape
(for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to
minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or
time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast
that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different
piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways
to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a
"global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how
much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years
have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of
approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to
data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly
used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture
processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine
learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book
reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data
sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it
particularly useful for some of these applications.},

Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to

Abstract      = {A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the
instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or an
object part. We use the length of the activity vector to represent the
probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the
instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via
transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level
capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes
active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system
achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than
a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these
results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level
capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity
vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the
lower-level capsule.},

Title         = {Predictable MDP Abstraction for Unsupervised Model-Based RL},
Eprint        = {2302.03921v2},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {A key component of model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a dynamics
model that predicts the outcomes of actions. Errors in this predictive model
can degrade the performance of model-based controllers, and complex Markov
decision processes (MDPs) can present exceptionally difficult prediction
problems. To mitigate this issue, we propose predictable MDP abstraction (PMA):
instead of training a predictive model on the original MDP, we train a model on
a transformed MDP with a learned action space that only permits predictable,
easy-to-model actions, while covering the original state-action space as much
as possible. As a result, model learning becomes easier and more accurate,
which allows robust, stable model-based planning or model-based RL. This
transformation is learned in an unsupervised manner, before any task is
specified by the user. Downstream tasks can then be solved with model-based
control in a zero-shot fashion, without additional environment interactions. We
theoretically analyze PMA and empirically demonstrate that PMA leads to
significant improvements over prior unsupervised model-based RL approaches in a
range of benchmark environments. Our code and videos are available at

Abstract      = {We consider an agent's uncertainty about its environment and the problem of
generalizing this uncertainty across observations. Specifically, we focus on
the problem of exploration in non-tabular reinforcement learning. Drawing
inspiration from the intrinsic motivation literature, we use density models to
measure uncertainty, and propose a novel algorithm for deriving a pseudo-count
from an arbitrary density model. This technique enables us to generalize
count-based exploration algorithms to the non-tabular case. We apply our ideas
to Atari 2600 games, providing sensible pseudo-counts from raw pixels. We
transform these pseudo-counts into intrinsic rewards and obtain significantly
improved exploration in a number of hard games, including the infamously
difficult Montezuma's Revenge.},

Abstract      = {In just three years, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have emerged as one of
the most popular approaches to unsupervised learning of complicated
distributions. VAEs are appealing because they are built on top of standard
function approximators (neural networks), and can be trained with stochastic
gradient descent. VAEs have already shown promise in generating many kinds of
complicated data, including handwritten digits, faces, house numbers, CIFAR
images, physical models of scenes, segmentation, and predicting the future from
static images. This tutorial introduces the intuitions behind VAEs, explains
the mathematics behind them, and describes some empirical behavior. No prior
knowledge of variational Bayesian methods is assumed.},

Eprint        = {2109.04504v2},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Meta-learning empowers artificial intelligence to increase its efficiency by
learning how to learn. Unlocking this potential involves overcoming a
challenging meta-optimisation problem. We propose an algorithm that tackles
this problem by letting the meta-learner teach itself. The algorithm first
bootstraps a target from the meta-learner, then optimises the meta-learner by
minimising the distance to that target under a chosen (pseudo-)metric. Focusing
on meta-learning with gradients, we establish conditions that guarantee
performance improvements and show that the metric can control
meta-optimisation. Meanwhile, the bootstrapping mechanism can extend the
effective meta-learning horizon without requiring backpropagation through all
updates. We achieve a new state-of-the art for model-free agents on the Atari
ALE benchmark and demonstrate that it yields both performance and efficiency
gains in multi-task meta-learning. Finally, we explore how bootstrapping opens
up new possibilities and find that it can meta-learn efficient exploration in
an epsilon-greedy Q-learning agent, without backpropagating through the update
rule.},
